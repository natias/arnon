 * "git describe --contains" often made a hard-to-justify choice of
   tag to name a given commit, because it tried to come up
   with a name with smallest number of hops from a tag, causing an old
   commit whose close descendant that is recently tagged were not
   described with respect to an old tag but with a newer tag.  It did
   not help that its computation of "hop" count was further tweaked to
   penalize being on a side branch of a merge.  The logic has been
   updated to favor using the tag with the oldest tagger date, which
   is a lot easier to explain to the end users: "We describe a commit
   in terms of the (chronologically) oldest tag that contains the
   commit."

 * "git clone" learned the "--shallow-submodules" option.

 * HTTP transport clients learned to throw extra HTTP headers at the
   server, specified via http.extraHeader configuration variable.

 * The "--compaction-heuristic" option to "git diff" family of
   commands enables a heuristic to make the patch output more readable
   by using a blank line as a strong hint that the contents before and
   after it belong to logically separate units.  It is still
   experimental.

 * A new configuration variable core.hooksPath allows customizing
   where the hook directory is.

 * An earlier addition of "sanitize_submodule_env" with 14111fc4 (git:
   submodule honor -c credential.* from command line, 2016-02-29)
   turned out to be a convoluted no-op; implement what it wanted to do
   correctly, and stop filtering settings given via "git -c var=val".

 * "git commit --dry-run" reported "No, no, you cannot commit." in one
   case where "git commit" would have allowed you to commit, and this
   improves it a little bit ("git commit --dry-run --short" still does
   not give you the correct answer, for example).  This is a stop-gap
   measure in that "commit --short --dry-run" still gives an incorrect
   result.

 * The experimental "multiple worktree" feature gains more safety to
   forbid operations on a branch that is checked out or being actively
   worked on elsewhere, by noticing that e.g. it is being rebased.

 * "git format-patch" learned a new "--base" option to record what
   (public, well-known) commit the original series was built on in
   its output.

 * "git commit" learned to pay attention to the "commit.verbose"
   configuration variable and act as if the "--verbose" option
   was given from the command line.

 * Updated documentation gives hints to GMail users with two-factor
   auth enabled that they need app-specific-password when using
   "git send-email".

 * The manpage output of our documentation did not render well in
   terminal; typeset literals in bold by default to make them stand
   out more.

 * The mark-up in the top-level README.md file has been updated to
   typeset CLI command names differently from the body text.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
   the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
   array of strings.

 * A test for tags has been restructured so that more parts of it can
   easily be run on a platform without a working GnuPG.

 * The startup_info data, which records if we are working inside a
   repository (among other things), are now uniformly available to Git
   subcommand implementations, and Git avoids attempting to touch
   references when we are not in a repository.

 * The command line argument parser for "receive-pack" has been
   rewritten to use parse-options.

 * A major part of "git submodule update" has been ported to C to take
   advantage of the recently added framework to run download tasks in
   parallel.  Other updates to "git submodule" that move pieces of
   logic to C continues.

 * Rename bunch of tests on "git clone" for better organization.

 * The tests that involve running httpd leaked the system-wide
   configuration in /etc/gitconfig to the tested environment.

 * Build updates for MSVC.

 * The repository set-up sequence has been streamlined (the biggest
   change is that there is no longer git_config_early()), so that we
   do not attempt to look into refs/* when we know we do not have a
   Git repository.

 * Code restructuring around the "refs" API to prepare for pluggable
   refs backends.

 * Sources to many test helper binaries and the generated helpers
   have been moved to t/helper/ subdirectory to reduce clutter at the
   top level of the tree.

 * Unify internal logic between "git tag -v" and "git verify-tag"
   commands by making one directly call into the other.

 * "merge-recursive" strategy incorrectly checked if a path that is
   involved in its internal merge exists in the working tree.

 * The test scripts for "git p4" (but not "git p4" implementation
   itself) has been updated so that they would work even on a system
   where the installed version of Python is python 3.

 * As nobody maintains our in-tree git.spec.in and distros use their
   own spec file, we stopped pretending that we support "make rpm".

 * Move from "unsigned char[20]" to "struct object_id" continues.

 * The code for warning_errno/die_errno has been refactored and a new
   error_errno() reporting helper is introduced.
   (merge 1da045f nd/error-errno later to maint).

 * Running tests with '-x' option to trace the individual command
   executions is a useful way to debug test scripts, but some tests
   that capture the standard error stream and check what the command
   said can be broken with the trace output mixed in.  When running
   our tests under "bash", however, we can redirect the trace output
   to another file descriptor to keep the standard error of programs
   being tested intact.

 * t0040 had too many unnecessary repetitions in its test data.  Teach
   test-parse-options program so that a caller can tell what it
   expects in its output, so that these repetitions can be cleaned up.

 * Add perf test for "rebase -i".

 * Common mistakes when writing gitlink: in our documentation are
   found by "make check-docs".

 * t9xxx series has been updated primarily for readability, while
   fixing small bugs in it.  A few scripted Porcelain commands have
   also been updated to fix possible bugs around their use of
   "test -z" and "test -n".

 * CI test was taught to run git-svn tests.

 * "git cat-file --batch-all" has been sped up, by taking advantage
   of the fact that it does not have to read a list of objects, in two
   ways.

 * test updates to make it more readable and maintainable.
   (merge e6273f4 es/t1500-modernize later to maint).

 * "make DEVELOPER=1" worked as expected; setting DEVELOPER=1 in
   config.mak didn't.
   (merge 51dd3e8 mm/makefile-developer-can-be-in-config-mak later to maint).

 * The way how "submodule--helper list" signals unmatch error to its
   callers has been updated.

 * A bash-ism "local" has been removed from "git submodule" scripted
   Porcelain.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.8
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.8 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * "git config --get-urlmatch", unlike other variants of the "git
   config --get" family, did not signal error with its exit status
   when there was no matching configuration.

 * The "--local-env-vars" and "--resolve-git-dir" options of "git
   rev-parse" failed to work outside a repository when the command's
   option parsing was rewritten in 1.8.5 era.

 * "git index-pack --keep[=<msg>] pack-$name.pack" simply did not work.

 * Fetching of history by naming a commit object name directly didn't
   work across remote-curl transport.

 * A small memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged in xdiff
   code.

 * strbuf_getwholeline() did not NUL-terminate the buffer on certain
   corner cases in its error codepath.

 * "git mergetool" did not work well with conflicts that both sides
   deleted.

 * "git send-email" had trouble parsing alias file in mailrc format
   when lines in it had trailing whitespaces on them.

 * When "git merge --squash" stopped due to conflict, the concluding
   "git commit" failed to read in the SQUASH_MSG that shows the log
   messages from all the squashed commits.

 * "git merge FETCH_HEAD" dereferenced NULL pointer when merging
   nothing into an unborn history (which is arguably unusual usage,
   which perhaps was the reason why nobody noticed it).

 * When "git worktree" feature is in use, "git branch -d" allowed
   deletion of a branch that is checked out in another worktree,
   which was wrong.

 * When "git worktree" feature is in use, "git branch -m" renamed a
   branch that is checked out in another worktree without adjusting
   the HEAD symbolic ref for the worktree.

 * "git diff -M" used to work better when two originally identical
   files A and B got renamed to X/A and X/B by pairing A to X/A and B
   to X/B, but this was broken in the 2.0 timeframe.

 * "git send-pack --all <there>" was broken when its command line
   option parsing was written in the 2.6 timeframe.

 * "git format-patch --help" showed `-s` and `--no-patch` as if these
   are valid options to the command.  We already hide `--patch` option
   from the documentation, because format-patch is about showing the
   diff, and the documentation now hides these options as well.

 * When running "git blame $path" with unnormalized data in the index
   for the path, the data in the working tree was blamed, even though
   "git add" would not have changed what is already in the index, due
   to "safe crlf" that disables the line-end conversion.  It has been
   corrected.

 * A change back in version 2.7 to "git branch" broke display of a
   symbolic ref in a non-standard place in the refs/ hierarchy (we
   expect symbolic refs to appear in refs/remotes/*/HEAD to point at
   the primary branch the remote has, and as .git/HEAD to point at the
   branch we locally checked out).

 * A partial rewrite of "git submodule" in the 2.7 timeframe changed
   the way the gitdir: pointer in the submodules point at the real
   repository location to use absolute paths by accident.  This has
   been corrected.

 * "git commit" misbehaved in a few minor ways when an empty message
   is given via -m '', all of which has been corrected.

 * Support for CRAM-MD5 authentication method in "git imap-send" did
   not work well.

 * Upcoming OpenSSL 1.1.0 will break compilation by updating a few API
   elements we use in imap-send, which has been adjusted for the change.

 * The socks5:// proxy support added back in 2.6.4 days was not aware
   that socks5h:// proxies behave differently from socks5:// proxies.

 * "git config" had a codepath that tried to pass a NULL to
   printf("%s"), which nobody seems to have noticed.

 * On Cygwin, object creation uses the "create a temporary and then
   rename it to the final name" pattern, not "create a temporary,
   hardlink it to the final name and then unlink the temporary"
   pattern.

   This is necessary to use Git on Windows shared directories, and is
   already enabled for the MinGW and plain Windows builds.  It also
   has been used in Cygwin packaged versions of Git for quite a while.
   See https://lore.kernel.org/git/20160419091055.GF2345@dinwoodie.org/

 * "merge-octopus" strategy did not ensure that the index is clean
   when merge begins.

 * When "git merge" notices that the merge can be resolved purely at
   the tree level (without having to merge blobs) and the resulting
   tree happens to already exist in the object store, it forgot to
   update the index, which left an inconsistent state that would
   break later operations.

 * "git submodule" reports the paths of submodules the command
   recurses into, but these paths were incorrectly reported when
   the command was not run from the root level of the superproject.

 * The "user.useConfigOnly" configuration variable makes it an error
   if users do not explicitly set user.name and user.email.  However,
   its check was not done early enough and allowed another error to
   trigger, reporting that the default value we guessed from the
   system setting was unusable.  This was a suboptimal end-user
   experience as we want the users to set user.name/user.email without
   relying on the auto-detection at all.

 * "git mv old new" did not adjust the path for a submodule that lives
   as a subdirectory inside old/ directory correctly.

 * "git replace -e" did not honour "core.editor" configuration.

 * "git push" from a corrupt repository that attempts to push a large
   number of refs deadlocked; the thread to relay rejection notices
   for these ref updates blocked on writing them to the main thread,
   after the main thread at the receiving end notices that the push
   failed and decides not to read these notices and return a failure.

 * mmap emulation on Windows has been optimized and work better without
   consuming paging store when not needed.

 * A question by "git send-email" to ask the identity of the sender
   has been updated.

 * UI consistency improvements for "git mergetool".

 * "git rebase -m" could be asked to rebase an entire branch starting
   from the root, but failed by assuming that there always is a parent
   commit to the first commit on the branch.

 * Fix a broken "p4 lfs" test.

 * Recent update to Git LFS broke "git p4" by changing the output from
   its "lfs pointer" subcommand.

 * "git fetch" test t5510 was flaky while running a (forced) automagic
   garbage collection.

 * Documentation updates to help contributors setting up Travis CI
   test for their patches.

 * Some multi-byte encoding can have a backslash byte as a later part
   of one letter, which would confuse "highlight" filter used in
   gitweb.

 * "git commit-tree" plumbing command required the user to always sign
   its result when the user sets the commit.gpgsign configuration
   variable, which was an ancient mistake.  Rework "git rebase" that
   relied on this mistake so that it reads commit.gpgsign and pass (or
   not pass) the -S option to "git commit-tree" to keep the end-user
   expectation the same, while teaching "git commit-tree" to ignore
   the configuration variable.  This will stop requiring the users to
   sign commit objects used internally as an implementation detail of
   "git stash".

 * "http.cookieFile" configuration variable clearly wants a pathname,
   but we forgot to treat it as such by e.g. applying tilde expansion.

 * Consolidate description of tilde-expansion that is done to
   configuration variables that take pathname to a single place.

 * Correct faulty recommendation to use "git submodule deinit ." when
   de-initialising all submodules, which would result in a strange
   error message in a pathological corner case.

 * Many 'linkgit:<git documentation page>' references were broken,
   which are all fixed with this.

 * "git rerere" can get confused by conflict markers deliberately left
   by the inner merge step, because they are indistinguishable from
   the real conflict markers left by the outermost merge which are
   what the end user and "rerere" need to look at.  This was fixed by
   making the conflict markers left by the inner merges a bit longer.
   (merge 0f9fd5c jc/ll-merge-internal later to maint).

 * CI test was taught to build documentation pages.

 * "git fsck" learned to catch NUL byte in a commit object as
   potential error and warn.

 * Portability enhancement for "rebase -i" to help platforms whose
   shell does not like "for i in <empty>" (which is not POSIX-kosher).

 * On Windows, .git and optionally any files whose name starts with a
   dot are now marked as hidden, with a core.hideDotFiles knob to
   customize this behaviour.

 * Documentation for "git merge --verify-signatures" has been updated
   to clarify that the signature of only the commit at the tip is
   verified.  Also the phrasing used for signature and key validity is
   adjusted to align with that used by OpenPGP.

 * A couple of bugs around core.autocrlf have been fixed.

 * Many commands normalize command line arguments from NFD to NFC
   variant of UTF-8 on OSX, but commands in the "diff" family did
   not, causing "git diff $path" to complain that no such path is
   known to Git.  They have been taught to do the normalization.

 * "git difftool" learned to handle unmerged paths correctly in
   dir-diff mode.

 * The "are we talking with TTY, doing an interactive session?"
   detection has been updated to work better for "Git for Windows".

 * We forgot to add "git log --decorate=auto" to documentation when we
   added the feature back in v2.1.0 timeframe.
   (merge 462cbb4 rj/log-decorate-auto later to maint).

 * "git fast-import --export-marks" would overwrite the existing marks
   file even when it makes a dump from its custom die routine.
   Prevent it from doing so when we have an import-marks file but
   haven't finished reading it.
   (merge f4beed6 fc/fast-import-broken-marks-file later to maint).

 * "git rebase -i", after it fails to auto-resolve the conflict, had
   an unnecessary call to "git rerere" from its very early days, which
   was spotted recently; the call has been removed.
   (merge 7063693 js/rebase-i-dedup-call-to-rerere later to maint).

 * Other minor clean-ups and documentation updates
   (merge cd82b7a pa/cherry-pick-doc-typo later to maint).
   (merge 2bb73ae rs/patch-id-use-skip-prefix later to maint).
   (merge aa20cbc rs/apply-name-terminate later to maint).
   (merge fe17fc0 jc/t2300-setup later to maint).
   (merge e256eec jk/shell-portability later to maint).

========================

Fixes since v2.9
----------------

 * When "git daemon" is run without --[init-]timeout specified, a
   connection from a client that silently goes offline can hang around
   for a long time, wasting resources.  The socket-level KEEPALIVE has
   been enabled to allow the OS to notice such failed connections.

 * The commands in `git log` family take %C(auto) in a custom format
   string.  This unconditionally turned the color on, ignoring
   --no-color or with --color=auto when the output is not connected to
   a tty; this was corrected to make the format truly behave as
   "auto".

 * "git rev-list --count" whose walk-length is limited with "-n"
   option did not work well with the counting optimized to look at the
   bitmap index.

 * "git show -W" (extend hunks to cover the entire function, delimited
   by lines that match the "funcname" pattern) used to show the entire
   file when a change added an entire function at the end of the file,
   which has been fixed.

 * The documentation set has been updated so that literal commands,
   configuration variables and environment variables are consistently
   typeset in fixed-width font and bold in manpages.

 * "git svn propset" subcommand that was added in 2.3 days is
   documented now.

 * The documentation tries to consistently spell "GPG"; when
   referring to the specific program name, "gpg" is used.

 * "git reflog" stopped upon seeing an entry that denotes a branch
   creation event (aka "unborn"), which made it appear as if the
   reflog was truncated.

 * The git-prompt scriptlet (in contrib/) was not friendly with those
   who uses "set -u", which has been fixed.

 * A codepath that used alloca(3) to place an unbounded amount of data
   on the stack has been updated to avoid doing so.

 * "git update-index --add --chmod=+x file" may be usable as an escape
   hatch, but not a friendly thing to force for people who do need to
   use it regularly.  "git add --chmod=+x file" can be used instead.

 * Build improvements for gnome-keyring (in contrib/)

 * "git status" used to say "working directory" when it meant "working
   tree".

 * Comments about misbehaving FreeBSD shells have been clarified with
   the version number (9.x and before are broken, newer ones are OK).

 * "git cherry-pick A" worked on an unborn branch, but "git
   cherry-pick A..B" didn't.

 * "git add -i/-p" learned to honor diff.compactionHeuristic
   experimental knob, so that the user can work on the same hunk split
   as "git diff" output.

 * "log --graph --format=" learned that "%>|(N)" specifies the width
   relative to the terminal's left edge, not relative to the area to
   draw text that is to the right of the ancestry-graph section.  It
   also now accepts negative N that means the column limit is relative
   to the right border.

 * The ownership rule for the piece of memory that hold references to
   be fetched in "git fetch" was screwy, which has been cleaned up.

 * "git bisect" makes an internal call to "git diff-tree" when
   bisection finds the culprit, but this call did not initialize the
   data structure to pass to the diff-tree API correctly.

 * Formats of the various data (and how to validate them) where we use
   GPG signature have been documented.

 * Fix an unintended regression in v2.9 that breaks "clone --depth"
   that recurses down to submodules by forcing the submodules to also
   be cloned shallowly, which many server instances that host upstream
   of the submodules are not prepared for.

 * Fix unnecessarily waste in the idiomatic use of ': ${VAR=default}'
   to set the default value, without enclosing it in double quotes.

 * Some platform-specific code had non-ANSI strict declarations of C
   functions that do not take any parameters, which has been
   corrected.

 * The internal code used to show local timezone offset is not
   prepared to handle timestamps beyond year 2100, and gave a
   bogus offset value to the caller.  Use a more benign looking
   +0000 instead and let "git log" going in such a case, instead
   of aborting.

 * One among four invocations of readlink(1) in our test suite has
   been rewritten so that the test can run on systems without the
   command (others are in valgrind test framework and t9802).

 * t/perf needs /usr/bin/time with GNU extension; the invocation of it
   is updated to "gtime" on Darwin.

 * A bug, which caused "git p4" while running under verbose mode to
   report paths that are omitted due to branch prefix incorrectly, has
   been fixed; the command said "Ignoring file outside of prefix" for
   paths that are _inside_.

 * The top level documentation "git help git" still pointed at the
   documentation set hosted at now-defunct google-code repository.
   Update it to point to https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html
   instead.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.

========================

Fixes since v2.9.1
------------------

 * A fix merged to v2.9.1 had a few tests that are not meant to be
   run on platforms without 64-bit long, which caused unnecessary
   test failures on them because we didn't detect the platform and
   skip them.  These tests are now skipped on platforms that they

========================

Fixes since v2.9.2
------------------

 * A helper function that takes the contents of a commit object and
   finds its subject line did not ignore leading blank lines, as is
   commonly done by other codepaths.  Make it ignore leading blank
   lines to match.

 * Git does not know what the contents in the index should be for a
   path added with "git add -N" yet, so "git grep --cached" should not
   show hits (or show lack of hits, with -L) in such a path, but that
   logic does not apply to "git grep", i.e. searching in the working
   tree files.  But we did so by mistake, which has been corrected.

 * "git rebase -i --autostash" did not restore the auto-stashed change
   when the operation was aborted.

 * "git commit --amend --allow-empty-message -S" for a commit without
   any message body could have misidentified where the header of the
   commit object ends.

 * More mark-up updates to typeset strings that are expected to
   literally typed by the end user in fixed-width font.

 * For a long time, we carried an in-code comment that said our
   colored output would work only when we use fprintf/fputs on
   Windows, which no longer is the case for the past few years.

 * "gc.autoPackLimit" when set to 1 should not trigger a repacking
   when there is only one pack, but the code counted poorly and did
   so.

 * One part of "git am" had an oddball helper function that called
   stuff from outside "his" as opposed to calling what we have "ours",
   which was not gender-neutral and also inconsistent with the rest of
   the system where outside stuff is usually called "theirs" in
   contrast to "ours".

 * The test framework learned a new helper test_match_signal to
   check an exit code from getting killed by an expected signal.

 * "git blame -M" missed a single line that was moved within the file.

 * Fix recently introduced codepaths that are involved in parallel
   submodule operations, which gave up on reading too early, and
   could have wasted CPU while attempting to write under a corner
   case condition.

 * "git grep -i" has been taught to fold case in non-ascii locales
   correctly.

 * A test that unconditionally used "mktemp" learned that the command
   is not necessarily available everywhere.

 * "git blame file" allowed the lineage of lines in the uncommitted,
   unadded contents of "file" to be inspected, but it refused when
   "file" did not appear in the current commit.  When "file" was
   created by renaming an existing file (but the change has not been
   committed), this restriction was unnecessarily tight.

 * "git add -N dir/file && git write-tree" produced an incorrect tree
   when there are other paths in the same directory that sorts after
   "file".

 * "git fetch http://user:pass@host/repo..." scrubbed the userinfo
   part, but "git push" didn't.

 * An age old bug that caused "git diff --ignore-space-at-eol"
   misbehave has been fixed.

 * "git notes merge" had a code to see if a path exists (and fails if
   it does) and then open the path for writing (when it doesn't).
   Replace it with open with O_EXCL.

 * "git pack-objects" and "git index-pack" mostly operate with off_t
   when talking about the offset of objects in a packfile, but there
   were a handful of places that used "unsigned long" to hold that
   value, leading to an unintended truncation.

 * Recent update to "git daemon" tries to enable the socket-level
   KEEPALIVE, but when it is spawned via inetd, the standard input
   file descriptor may not necessarily be connected to a socket.
   Suppress an ENOTSOCK error from setsockopt().

 * Recent FreeBSD stopped making perl available at /usr/bin/perl;
   switch the default the built-in path to /usr/local/bin/perl on not
   too ancient FreeBSD releases.

 * "git status" learned to suggest "merge --abort" during a conflicted
   merge, just like it already suggests "rebase --abort" during a
   conflicted rebase.

 * The .c/.h sources are marked as such in our .gitattributes file so
   that "git diff -W" and friends would work better.

 * Existing autoconf generated test for the need to link with pthread
   library did not check all the functions from pthread libraries;
   recent FreeBSD has some functions in libc but not others, and we
   mistakenly thought linking with libc is enough when it is not.

 * Allow http daemon tests in Travis CI tests.

 * Users of the parse_options_concat() API function need to allocate
   extra slots in advance and fill them with OPT_END() when they want
   to decide the set of supported options dynamically, which makes the
   code error-prone and hard to read.  This has been corrected by tweaking
   the API to allocate and return a new copy of "struct option" array.

 * The use of strbuf in "git rm" to build filename to remove was a bit
   suboptimal, which has been fixed.

 * "git commit --help" said "--no-verify" is only about skipping the
   pre-commit hook, and failed to say that it also skipped the
   commit-msg hook.

 * "git merge" in Git v2.9 was taught to forbid merging an unrelated
   lines of history by default, but that is exactly the kind of thing
   the "--rejoin" mode of "git subtree" (in contrib/) wants to do.
   "git subtree" has been taught to use the "--allow-unrelated-histories"
   option to override the default.

 * The build procedure for "git persistent-https" helper (in contrib/)
   has been updated so that it can be built with more recent versions
   of Go.

 * There is an optimization used in "git diff $treeA $treeB" to borrow
   an already checked-out copy in the working tree when it is known to
   be the same as the blob being compared, expecting that open/mmap of
   such a file is faster than reading it from the object store, which
   involves inflating and applying delta.  This however kicked in even
   when the checked-out copy needs to go through the convert-to-git
   conversion (including the clean filter), which defeats the whole
   point of the optimization.  The optimization has been disabled when
   the conversion is necessary.

 * "git -c grep.patternType=extended log --basic-regexp" misbehaved
   because the internal API to access the grep machinery was not
   designed well.

 * Windows port was failing some tests in t4130, due to the lack of
   inum in the returned values by its lstat(2) emulation.

 * The characters in the label shown for tags/refs for commits in
   "gitweb" output are now properly escaped for proper HTML output.

 * FreeBSD can lie when asked mtime of a directory, which made the
   untracked cache code to fall back to a slow-path, which in turn
   caused tests in t7063 to fail because it wanted to verify the
   behaviour of the fast-path.

 * Squelch compiler warnings for netmalloc (in compat/) library.

 * The API documentation for hashmap was unclear if hashmap_entry
   can be safely discarded without any other consideration.  State
   that it is safe to do so.

 * Not-so-recent rewrite of "git am" that started making internal
   calls into the commit machinery had an unintended regression, in
   that no matter how many seconds it took to apply many patches, the
   resulting committer timestamp for the resulting commits were all
   the same.

 * "git difftool <paths>..." started in a subdirectory failed to
   interpret the paths relative to that directory, which has been
   fixed.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.

========================

Fixes since v2.9.3
------------------

 * There are certain house-keeping tasks that need to be performed at
   the very beginning of any Git program, and programs that are not
   built-in commands had to do them exactly the same way as "git"
   potty does.  It was easy to make mistakes in one-off standalone
   programs (like test helpers).  A common "main()" function that
   calls cmd_main() of individual program has been introduced to
   make it harder to make mistakes.

 * "git merge" with renormalization did not work well with
   merge-recursive, due to "safer crlf" conversion kicking in when it
   shouldn't.

 * The reflog output format is documented better, and a new format
   --date=unix to report the seconds-since-epoch (without timezone)
   has been added.

 * "git push --force-with-lease" already had enough logic to allow
   ensuring that such a push results in creation of a ref (i.e. the
   receiving end did not have another push from sideways that would be
   discarded by our force-pushing), but didn't expose this possibility
   to the users.  It does so now.

 * "import-tars" fast-import script (in contrib/) used to ignore a
   hardlink target and replaced it with an empty file, which has been
   corrected to record the same blob as the other file the hardlink is
   shared with.

 * "git mv dir non-existing-dir/" did not work in some environments
   the same way as existing mainstream platforms.  The code now moves
   "dir" to "non-existing-dir", without relying on rename("A", "B/")
   that strips the trailing slash of '/'.

 * The "t/" hierarchy is prone to get an unusual pathname; "make test"
   has been taught to make sure they do not contain paths that cannot
   be checked out on Windows (and the mechanism can be reusable to
   catch pathnames that are not portable to other platforms as need
   arises).

 * When "git merge-recursive" works on history with many criss-cross
   merges in "verbose" mode, the names the command assigns to the
   virtual merge bases could have overwritten each other by unintended
   reuse of the same piece of memory.

 * "git checkout --detach <branch>" used to give the same advice
   message as that is issued when "git checkout <tag>" (or anything
   that is not a branch name) is given, but asking with "--detach" is
   an explicit enough sign that the user knows what is going on.  The
   advice message has been squelched in this case.

 * "git difftool" by default ignores the error exit from the backend
   commands it spawns, because often they signal that they found
   differences by exiting with a non-zero status code just like "diff"
   does; the exit status codes 126 and above however are special in
   that they are used to signal that the command is not executable,
   does not exist, or killed by a signal.  "git difftool" has been
   taught to notice these exit status codes.

 * On Windows, help.browser configuration variable used to be ignored,
   which has been corrected.

 * The "git -c var[=val] cmd" facility to append a configuration
   variable definition at the end of the search order was described in
   git(1) manual page, but not in git-config(1), which was more likely
   place for people to look for when they ask "can I make a one-shot
   override, and if so how?"

 * The tempfile (hence its user lockfile) API lets the caller to open
   a file descriptor to a temporary file, write into it and then
   finalize it by first closing the filehandle and then either
   removing or renaming the temporary file.  When the process spawns a
   subprocess after obtaining the file descriptor, and if the
   subprocess has not exited when the attempt to remove or rename is
   made, the last step fails on Windows, because the subprocess has
   the file descriptor still open.  Open tempfile with O_CLOEXEC flag
   to avoid this (on Windows, this is mapped to O_NOINHERIT).

 * "git-shell" rejects a request to serve a repository whose name
   begins with a dash, which makes it no longer possible to get it
   confused into spawning service programs like "git-upload-pack" with
   an option like "--help", which in turn would spawn an interactive
   pager, instead of working with the repository user asked to access
   (i.e. the one whose name is "--help").

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
