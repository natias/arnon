  [BUG FIXES]
  - Adjust the privs needed for the DROP/CREATE table test. [GH#35]
    (Joe Crotty)

  - Fixed RT84170 - when using scrollable cursors and you've done a
    positioned fetch and then keep fetching until the end of the
    result-set calls to fetch never return undef and you keep getting
    the last row forever. Also added test case to the 51scroll.t test
    (Martin J. Evans).

  [BUG FIXES]

  - fix RT46628 - bind_param_inout ORA_RSET causes MSWin32 access
    violation and RT82663 - Errors if a returned SYS_REFCURSOR is not
    opened (Martin J. Evans)

  - Fix RT82663. If a procedure/function returns a SYS_REFCURSOR which
    was never opened DBD::Oracle magics a DBI statement handle into
    existence and attempts to describe it (which fails). This change
    examines a returned SYS_REFCURSOR and if it it is initialised but
    not executed does not create a DBI statement handle and returns
    undef instead. So now if you have a procedure/function which
    returns a SYS_REFCURSOR and never open it you'll get undef back
    instead of a useless statement handle.  Extended 50cursor.t test
    to check the above fix. (Martin J. Evans)

  [BUG FIXES]
  - Fix RT69350 - 31lob.t was using $lob after destroying its parent $sth
        (Rob Davies)

  - Fix memory leak in execute_array (John Scoles, Pierre-Alain Blanc)

  - Fix RT80349 - The error message in execute_for_fetch when a row fails
    can contain the wrong error count. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for
    RT and patch.

  - Fix RT80375 - no exception when execute_for_fetch fails and
    ArrayTupleStatus is not specified. Also the tuple count calculation
    resulted in an undefined warning. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for
    RT and patch.

  - Fix RT80487. Skip XMLType tests if Oracle less than V9. Thanks to
    Steffen Goeldner for RT and patch.

  - Fix RT80486 for 31lob_extended.t. In old old Oracle8,

    11 but not >= 11.2 (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_server_version was not documented.

  - Fix RT80566. 70meta.t test fails with Oracle 8 because
    ALL_TAB_COLUMNS.CHAR_LENGTH is new in Oracle 9. Use DATA_LENGTH
    instead on pre-9 versions. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for RT and
    patch.

  - Fix RT80704. 51scroll.t test checks scrollable cursors but assumes
    all Oracles support them (only 9 and above). Thanks to Steffen
    Goeldner for RT and patch.

    introduced in Oracle 9. Skip if < Oracle 9. Thanks to Steffen
    Goeldner for RT and patch.

  - Fix RT81317. 34pres_lobs.t uses the Data Interface for Persistent
    LOBs which is new in Oracle 9. Skip if < Oracle 9. Thanks to
    Steffen Goeldner for RT and patch.

  [MISCELLANEOUS]

  - The original 26exe_array test was replaced some time ago with a
    copy of the one from DBD::ODBC. Since then I've fixed issues in
    the DBD::ODBC one and added more tests (like tests for some RTs
    above). To make keeping them in synch easier I've modularised the
    tests. Hence new ExecuteArray.pm. (Martin J. Evans)

  - simple code clean up, replacing 3 uses of safemalloc with Newz
    (John Scoles)

  - Add DBI as a configure prereq for the META* files (thanks to Joe Crotty)

  [BUG FIXES]

  - fix serious memory corruption in TAF support (Martin J. Evans)

  - fix finding client in situation where client and server both
    installed but different architectures (patch by H.Merijn Brand)

  - fix memory leak in TAF handling - the TAF function was leaked
    (Martin J. Evans)

  - fix issue with taf_function being set to a scalar which goes
    out of scope before the callback is made (Martin J. Evans)

  - fix RT46739 if a connection breaks the environment handle is
    not thrown away (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_driver_name was not defaulted to the correct DBD::Oracle
    version (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_driver_name, ora_client_info, ora_client_identifier,
    ora_action and ora_oci_success_warn were set twice (if specified)
    on connect as they were not deleted from the connect attributes
    once handled. Code now leaves the setting to the later STORE DBI
    calls (Martin J. Evans)

  - fixed some compiler warnings for %lf (Martin J. Evans)

  - fixed RT78700 - column_info reports wrong size for char semantic
    char type columns (Douglas Wilson).

  [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]

  - ora_taf and ora_taf_sleep were redundant and have been removed.
    To enable/disable TAF simply set ora_taf_function and if you
    want to sleep do it in your callback (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_taf_function can now be a code reference as well as a string
    (Martin J. Evans)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - the ora_can_taf method was virtually useless since you can only
    call it after connecting and to enable TAF you had to do it in the
    connect call. Now you can enable and disable TAF at any time by
    simply setting or clearing the ora_taf_function (see RT78811)
    (Martin J. Evans)

  - the ora_taf_function is now passed a third argument of the
    connection handle (Martin J. Evans)

  - RT78987 - removed Oraperl.pm and oraperl.ph; these files will be
    available in a separate distribution named "Oraperl" (David Perry)

  [MISCELLANEOUS]

  - hide dr, db and st packages from PAUSE (Martin J. Evans)

  - added a few more simple TAF tests (Martin J. Evans)

    Martin J. Evans

  [DOCUMENTATION]
  - Promoted the troubleshooting for the different architectures to
    POD documents, for easier/prettier access.

  - Added a troubleshooting entry for RT71819 - bound output
    parameters may be returned in the wrong order (Martin J. Evans)

1.46      2012-07-11
 - promote 1.45_00 to official release

1.45_00   2012-06-21

 [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]

 - In future versions of DBD::Oracle ora_verbose will be changed
   so that it is simply a switch to turn DBI's DBD tracing on or off.
   A true value will turn it on and a false value will turn it off.
   DBI's "DBD" tracing was not available when ora_verbose was created
   and ora_verbose adds an additional test to every trace test.

 [BUG FIXES]

 - Fixed RT76695 - offset passed to ora_fetch_scroll should not affect
   normal fetches (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed RT76410 - fetch after fetch absolute always returns
   the same row (Martin J. Evans);

 - Fixed RT75721 - does not build with Oracle 9.2 (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed RT71343 - Oracle 9i does not have OCI_ATTR_TAF_ENABLED
   or OCI_ATTR_RESERVED_15/16 so cannot build (Martin J. Evans)

 - skip 24implicit_utf8.t if chr set is not UTF-8 (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed RT76269 - ora_taf_sleep was documented as taf_sleep by
   accident. There was no way to stop the TAF reconnect attempts.
   If you want to try another connect attempt in your taf handler you
   now need to return OCI_FO_RETRY from it. (Martin J. Evans)

 [MISCELLANEOUS]

 - minor change to confusing debug output for input parameters
   (Martin J. Evans)

 - RT72989 - add note to trouble shooting guide re this RT and
   Module::Runtime (Martin J. Evans)

1.44      2012-04-23
 - promote 1.43_00 to official release

1.43_00   2012-03-30

 [BUG FIXES]
 - Applied patch from Rafael Kitover (Caelum) to column_info to handle
   DEFAULT columns greater in length than the DBI default of 80. The
   DEFAULT column is a long and it is a PITA to have to set
   LongReadLen which you can only do on a connection handle in
   DBD::Oracle. The default maximum size is now 1Mb; above that you
   will still have to set LongReadLen (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed 70meta and rt74753-utf8-encoded to not die if you cannot
   connect to Oracle or you cannot install from CPAN if you have not
   set up a valid Oracle connection.

 - Fixed 75163. Bfile lobs were not being opened before fetching if
   ora_auto_lobs was disabled (Martin J. Evans).

   Note: this has a minor impact on non bfile lobs when ora_auto_lobs
   is not in force as an additional call to OCILobFileIsOpen will be
   made.

 - Removed all DBIS usage fixing and speeding up threaded
   Perls (Martin J. Evans).

 - Minor fix to avoid use of uninitialised variable in 31lob.t (Martin J. Evans)

 [DOCUMENTATION]

 [BUG FIXES]
 - if bind_col is called with a TYPE but no bind attributes like
   StrictlyTyped or DiscardString are set DBD::Oracle still attempts
   to call sql_type_cast which is pointless (Martin J. Evans)
 - if bind_col is called with a TYPE other than SQL_NUMERIC,

* Changes in DBD-Oracle 1.16 (svn rev 515)   22nd October 2004

  NOTE:
  This release has major changes to Unicode support. See below.
  It no longer supports the old Oracle 7 OCI interface.
  It requires DBI >= 1.38 for some of the tests if using Perl 5.6.
  It no longer supports Perl 5.5 or earlier.

  Fixed placeholder names to be case insensitive thanks to Charles Jardine.
  Fixed some LOB test problems with Oracle 8.1.7 by implementing ora_lob_append
    with OCILobGetLength() and OCILobWrite(), instead of buggy OCILobWriteAppend(),
    if the Oracle client version is < 9.0. Thanks to Jeff Urlwin.
  Fixed handling of temporary LOBs thanks to Chris Donnelly.
  Fixed memory leaks in auto LOB refetch code thanks to Dongqiang Bai.
  Fixed reporting of length truncated in error message thanks to Jeff Urlwin.

  Fixed Oraperl to not enable PrintError or AutoCommit (broken since 1.13).

  Changed some utf8 internals for LOBs.
  Changed ORA_OCI constant from being just 7 or 8 to being a dualvar:
    in numeric context returns the major.minor version number (8.1, 9.2 etc)
    in string context it returns the full "major.minor.foo.bar" version string.
  Changed some SUCCESS_WITH_INFO situations to be treated as a "warning"
    by setting $DBI::err to "0" (and so trigger PrintWarn in DBI >= 1.43)
    eg "ORA-28011: the account will expire soon; change your password now"
    and package compilation errors.

  Added automatic support for UTF-8 for both NLS_LANG and NLS_NCHAR
    Many thanks to Lincoln Baxter who did most of the hard work and testing
    and to Jeff Urlwin and others who also helped out.
    Perl 5.8.x and Oracle 9+ are highly recommended if you want to use Unicode.
    See POD for more information and documentation.
  Added support for "... RETURNING lob_locator_column INTO ?"
    using $sth->bind_param_inout(2, \$loc, 0, {ora_type => ORA_BLOB});

* Changes in DBD-Oracle 1.15   27th January 2004

  NOTE: DBD::Oracle now requires DBI version 1.28 (June 2002) or later.

  NOTE: This is probably the last release that will support being
  built with the old Oracle 7 OCI interface.

  NOTE: This release will build for perl 5.5 only after some manual edits
  which are detailed in README.help.  Future releases may not build for 5.5.
  Perl 5.5.3 is very old and and upgrading to at least 5.6.1 is recommended.
  The DBI itself has required perl >= 5.6.0 since DBI 1.38, August 2003.

  Fixed Makefile.PL for HPUX thanks to H.Merijn Brand & Sweth Chandramouli.
  Fixed Makefile.PL for handling 32/64bit libs thanks to Lincoln Baxter,
    Sean Kelly, Joel Van Boeckel and others. Oh the fun we've had.

  Fixed bind_param_inout() for placeholders not assigned to in PL/SQL.

  Changed bind_param_inout for CHAR types to no longer use a minimum
    length of 28 characters. Warning: this change may break code that
    doesn't pass bind_param_inout() a length value large enough for the
    returned string. (The minimum length was not documented and should
    not have been relied upon. This change currently only applies to the
    CHAR type but may extended to all string types in a later release.)
  Changed type_info_all() to return the same type info as Oracle's own
    ODBC driver does, thanks to Andy Hassall for the data.
    The types include LOBs but not the new TIMESTAMP and INTERVAL types.

  Added direct access to LOB Locators and major LOB Locator functions
    such as $sth->ora_lob_read(...), $sth->ora_lob_write(...) etc.
    This work was sponsored by Geospiza Inc.

    via ora_use_proc_connection attribute, thanks to Kristian Nielsen
    needs build time option thanks to Steffen Goeldner

  Added auto setting of $dbh->{Username} if not given to connect
    i.e. using Oracle OS authentication and connecting as "/"
