==============================================================================
VERSION 7.4				*version-7.4* *version7.4* *vim-7.4*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.3 and 7.4.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes and there are a few new features.  The
most notable new features are:

- New regexp engine			|new-regexp-engine|
- A more pythonic Python interface	|better-python-interface|


New regexp engine					*new-regexp-engine*
-----------------

What is now called the "old" regexp engine uses a backtracking algorithm.  It
tries to match the pattern with the text in one way, and when that fails it
goes back and tries another way.  This works fine for simple patterns, but
complex patterns can be very slow on longer text.

The new engine uses a state machine.  It tries all possible alternatives at
the current character and stores the possible states of the pattern.  This is
a bit slower for simple patterns, but much faster for complex patterns and
long text.

Most notably, syntax highlighting for Javascript and XML files with long lines
is now working fine.  Previously Vim could get stuck.

More information here: |two-engines|


Better Python interface				*better-python-interface*
-----------------------

Added |python-bindeval| function. Unlike |python-eval| this one returns
|python-Dictionary|, |python-List| and |python-Function| objects for
dictionaries lists and functions respectively in place of their Python
built-in equivalents (or None if we are talking about function references).
   For simple types this function returns Python built-in types and not only
Python `str()` like |python-eval| does. On Python 3 it will return `bytes()`
objects in place of `str()` ones avoiding possibility of UnicodeDecodeError.
   Interface of new objects mimics standard Python `dict()` and `list()`
interfaces to some extent. Extent will be improved in the future.

Added special |python-vars| objects also available for |python-buffer| and
|python-window|. They ease access to Vim script variables from Python.

Now you no longer need to alter `sys.path` to import your module: special
hooks are responsible for importing from {rtp}/python2, {rtp}/python3 and
{rtp}/pythonx directories (for Python 2, Python 3 and both respectively).
See |python-special-path|.

Added possibility to work with |tabpage|s through |python-tabpage| object.

Added automatic conversion of Vim errors and exceptions to Python
exceptions.

Changed the behavior of the |python-buffers| object: it now uses buffer numbers
as keys in place of the index of the buffer in the internal buffer list.
This should not break anything as the only way to get this index was
iterating over |python-buffers|.

Added |:pydo| and |:py3do| commands.

Added the |pyeval()| and |py3eval()| functions.

Now in all places which previously accepted `str()` objects, `str()` and
`unicode()` (Python 2) or `bytes()` and `str()` (Python 3) are accepted.

|python-window| has gained `.col` and `.row` attributes that are currently
the only way to get internal window positions.

Added or fixed support for `dir()` in Vim Python objects.


Changed							*changed-7.4*
-------

Old Python versions (≤2.2) are no longer supported. Building with them did
not work anyway.

Options:
	Added ability to automatically save the selection into the system
	clipboard when using non-GUI version of Vim (autoselectplus in
	'clipboard'). Also added ability to use the system clipboard as
	default register (previously only primary selection could be used).
	(Ivan Krasilnikov, Christian Brabandt, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added a special 'shiftwidth' value that makes 'sw' follow 'tabstop'.
	As indenting via 'indentexpr' became tricky |shiftwidth()| function
	was added. Also added equivalent special value to 'softtabstop'
	option.  (Christian Brabandt, so8res)

	Show absolute number in number column when 'relativenumber' option is
	on.  Now there are four combinations with 'number' and
	'relativenumber'.  (Christian Brabandt)

Commands:
	|:diffoff| now saves the local values of some settings and restores
	them in place of blindly resetting them to the defaults. (Christian
	Brabandt)

Other:
	Lua interface now also uses userdata bound to Vim structures. (Taro
	Muraoka, Luis Carvalho)

	glob() and autocommand patterns used to work with the undocumented
	"\{n,m\}" item from a regexp.  "\{" is now used for a literal "{", as
	this is normal in shell file patterns.  Now used "\\\{n,m\}" to get
	"\{n,m}" in the regexp pattern.

-----

Various syntax, indent and other plugins were added.

Added support for |Lists| and |Dictionaries| in |viminfo|. (Christian
Brabandt)

Functions:
	Bitwise functions: |and()|, |or()|, |invert()|, |xor()|.

	Added |luaeval()| function. (Taro Muraoka, Luis Carvalho)

	Added |sha256()| function. (Tyru, Hirohito Higashi)

	Debugging functions: |screenattr()|, |screenchar()|, |screencol()|,
	|screenrow()|. (Simon Ruderich, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added ability to use |Dictionary-function|s for |sort()|ing, via
	optional third argument. (Nikolay Pavlov)

	Added special |expand()| argument that expands to the current line
	number.

	Made it possible to force |char2nr()| to always give unicode codepoints
	regardless of current encoding. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

	Made it possible for functions generating file list generate |List|
	and not NL-separated string. (e.g. |glob()|, |expand()|) (Christian
	Brabandt)

	Functions that obtain variables from the specific window, tabpage or
	buffer scope dictionary can now return specified default value in
	place of empty string in case variable is not found. (|gettabvar()|,
	|getwinvar()|, |getbufvar()|) (Shougo Matsushita, Hirohito Higashi)

Autocommands:
	Added |InsertCharPre| event launched before inserting character.
	(Jakson A. Aquino)

	Added |CompleteDone| event launched after finishing completion in
	insert mode. (idea by Florian Klein)

	Added |QuitPre| event launched when commands that can either close Vim
	or only some window(s) are launched.

	Added |TextChanged| and |TextChangedI| events launched when text is
	changed.

Commands:
	|:syntime| command useful for debugging.

	Made it possible to remove all signs from the current buffer using
	|:sign-unplace|. (Christian Brabandt)

	Added |:language| autocompletion. (Dominique Pelle)

	Added more |:command-complete| completion types: |:behave| suboptions,
	color schemes, compilers, |:cscope| suboptions, files from 'path',
	|:history| suboptions, locale names, |:syntime| suboptions, user
	names. (Dominique Pelle)

	Added |:map-nowait| creating mapping which when having lhs that is the
	prefix of another mapping’s lhs will not allow Vim to wait for user to
	type more characters to resolve ambiguity, forcing Vim to take the
	shorter alternative: one with <nowait>.

Options:
	Made it possible to ignore case when completing: 'wildignorecase'.

	Added ability to delete comment leader when using |J| by `j` flag in
	'formatoptions' (|fo-table|). (Lech Lorens)

	Added ability to control indentation inside namespaces: |cino-N|.
	(Konstantin Lepa)

	Added ability to control alignment inside `if` condition separately
	from alignment inside function arguments: |cino-k|. (Lech Lorens)

Other:
	Improved support for cmd.exe. (Ben Fritz, Bram Moolenaar)

	Added |v:windowid| variable containing current window number in GUI
	Vim. (Christian J. Robinson, Lech Lorens)
