    restrictions:

    1. This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    2. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by
       explicit claim or by omission. In practice, this means that if you use
       PCRE in software that you distribute to others, commercially or
       otherwise, you must put a sentence like this

         Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
         which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
         by the University of Cambridge, England.

       somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant
       files or online help data or similar. A reference to the ftp site for
       the source, that is, to

         ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

       should also be given in the documentation. However, this condition is not
       intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
       it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
       A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
       independently).

    3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
       misrepresented as being the original software.

    4. If PCRE is embedded in any software that is released under the GNU
      General Purpose Licence (GPL), or Lesser General Purpose Licence (LGPL),
      then the terms of that licence shall supersede any condition above with
      which it is incompatible.
