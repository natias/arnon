You might remember C<ok() or diag()> with the mnemonic C<open() or
die()>.

B<NOTE> The exact formatting of the diagnostic output is still
changing, but it is guaranteed that whatever you throw at it won't
interfere with the test.

=item B<note>

  note(@diagnostic_message);

Like C<diag()>, except the message will not be seen when the test is run
in a harness.  It will only be visible in the verbose TAP stream.

Handy for putting in notes which might be useful for debugging, but
don't indicate a problem.

    note("Tempfile is $tempfile");

Will dump the contents of any references in a human readable format.
Usually you want to pass this into C<note> or C<diag>.

Handy for things like...

    is_deeply($have, $want) || diag explain $have;

or

=head2 Conditional tests

Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the
test script to die.  A certain function or method isn't implemented
(such as C<fork()> on MacOS), some resource isn't available (like a 
net connection) or a module isn't available.  In these cases it's
necessary to skip tests, or declare that they are supposed to fail
but will work in the future (a todo test).

For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see
L<Test::Harness>.

The way Test::More handles this is with a named block.  Basically, a
block of tests which can be skipped over or made todo.  It's best if I
just show you...

=over 4

=item B<SKIP: BLOCK>

  SKIP: {
      skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

      ...normal testing code goes here...
  }

This declares a block of tests that might be skipped, $how_many tests
there are, $why and under what $condition to skip them.  An example is
the easiest way to illustrate:

    SKIP: {
        eval { require HTML::Lint };

        skip "HTML::Lint not installed", 2 if $@;

        my $lint = new HTML::Lint;
        isa_ok( $lint, "HTML::Lint" );

        $lint->parse( $html );
        is( $lint->errors, 0, "No errors found in HTML" );
    }

If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole block of
code I<won't be run at all>.  Test::More will output special ok's
which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing, tests.

It's important that $how_many accurately reflects the number of tests
in the SKIP block so the # of tests run will match up with your plan.
If your plan is C<no_plan> $how_many is optional and will default to 1.

It's perfectly safe to nest SKIP blocks.  Each SKIP block must have
the label C<SKIP>, or Test::More can't work its magic.

You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug in your
program, or for which you don't yet have code written.  For that you
use TODO.  Read on.

=cut

## no critic (Subroutines::RequireFinalReturn)
sub skip {
    my( $why, $how_many ) = @_;
    my $tb = Test::More->builder;

    # If the plan is set, and is static, then skip needs a count. If the plan
    # is 'no_plan' we are fine. As well if plan is undefined then we are
    # waiting for done_testing.
    unless (defined $how_many) {
        my $plan = $tb->has_plan;
        _carp "skip() needs to know \$how_many tests are in the block"
            if $plan && $plan =~ m/^\d+$/;
        $how_many = 1;
    }

    if( defined $how_many and $how_many =~ /\D/ ) {
        _carp
          "skip() was passed a non-numeric number of tests.  Did you get the arguments backwards?";
        $how_many = 1;
    }

    for( 1 .. $how_many ) {
        $tb->skip($why);
    }

    no warnings 'exiting';
    last SKIP;
}

=item B<TODO: BLOCK>

    TODO: {
        local $TODO = $why if $condition;

        ...normal testing code goes here...
    }

Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and $why.  Perhaps it's
because you haven't fixed a bug or haven't finished a new feature:

    TODO: {
        local $TODO = "URI::Geller not finished";

        my $card = "Eight of clubs";
        is( URI::Geller->your_card, $card, 'Is THIS your card?' );

        my $spoon;
        URI::Geller->bend_spoon;
        is( $spoon, 'bent',    "Spoon bending, that's original" );
    }

With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail.  Test::More
will run the tests normally, but print out special flags indicating
they are "todo".  L<Test::Harness> will interpret failures as being ok.
Should anything succeed, it will report it as an unexpected success.
You then know the thing you had todo is done and can remove the
TODO flag.

The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply commenting out a
block of tests, is that it is like having a programmatic todo list.  You know
how much work is left to be done, you're aware of what bugs there are,
and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.

Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the block.
When the block is empty, delete it.

Note that, if you leave $TODO unset or undef, Test::More reports failures
as normal. This can be useful to mark the tests as expected to fail only
in certain conditions, e.g.:

    TODO: {
        local $TODO = "$^O doesn't work yet. :(" if !_os_is_supported($^O);

        ...
    }

=item B<todo_skip>

    TODO: {
        todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

        ...normal testing code...
    }

With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run.  That way
you'll know when they start passing.  Sometimes this isn't possible.
Often a failing test will cause the whole program to die or hang, even
inside an C<eval BLOCK> with and using C<alarm>.  In these extreme
cases you have no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.

The syntax and behavior is similar to a C<SKIP: BLOCK> except the
tests will be marked as failing but todo.  L<Test::Harness> will
interpret them as passing.

=cut

sub todo_skip {
    my( $why, $how_many ) = @_;
    my $tb = Test::More->builder;

    unless( defined $how_many ) {
        # $how_many can only be avoided when no_plan is in use.
        _carp "todo_skip() needs to know \$how_many tests are in the block"
          unless $tb->has_plan eq 'no_plan';
        $how_many = 1;
    }

    for( 1 .. $how_many ) {
        $tb->todo_skip($why);
    }

    no warnings 'exiting';
    last TODO;
}

=item When do I use SKIP vs. TODO?

B<If it's something the user might not be able to do>, use SKIP.
This includes optional modules that aren't installed, running under
an OS that doesn't have some feature (like C<fork()> or symlinks), or maybe
you need an Internet connection and one isn't available.

B<If it's something the programmer hasn't done yet>, use TODO.  This
is for any code you haven't written yet, or bugs you have yet to fix,
but want to put tests in your testing script (always a good idea).

should terminate.  This includes the running of any additional test scripts.

This is typically used when testing cannot continue such as a critical
module failing to compile or a necessary external utility not being
available such as a database connection failing.

=head2 Discouraged comparison functions

The use of the following functions is discouraged as they are not
actually testing functions and produce no diagnostics to help figure
out what went wrong.  They were written before C<is_deeply()> existed
because I couldn't figure out how to display a useful diff of two
arbitrary data structures.

These functions are usually used inside an C<ok()>.

    ok( eq_array(\@got, \@expected) );

C<is_deeply()> can do that better and with diagnostics.  

    is_deeply( \@got, \@expected );

They may be deprecated in future versions.

=head2 Extending and Embedding Test::More

Sometimes the Test::More interface isn't quite enough.  Fortunately,
Test::More is built on top of L<Test::Builder> which provides a single,
unified backend for any test library to use.  This means two test
libraries which both use L<Test::Builder> B<can> be used together in the
same program.

If you simply want to do a little tweaking of how the tests behave,
you can access the underlying L<Test::Builder> object like so:

=over 4

=item B<builder>

    my $test_builder = Test::More->builder;

Returns the L<Test::Builder> object underlying Test::More for you to play
with.


=back


=head1 EXIT CODES

If all your tests passed, L<Test::Builder> will exit with zero (which is
normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If
you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras)
will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run L<Test::Builder>
will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after
having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be
considered a failure and will exit with 255.

So the exit codes are...

    0                   all tests successful
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

B<NOTE>  This behavior may go away in future versions.


=head1 COMPATIBILITY

Test::More works with Perls as old as 5.8.1.

Thread support is not very reliable before 5.10.1, but that's
because threads are not very reliable before 5.10.1.

Although Test::More has been a core module in versions of Perl since 5.6.2, Test::More has evolved since then, and not all of the features you're used to will be present in the shipped version of Test::More. If you are writing a module, don't forget to indicate in your package metadata the minimum version of Test::More that you require. For instance, if you want to use C<done_testing()> but want your test script to run on Perl 5.10.0, you will need to explicitly require Test::More > 0.88.

Key feature milestones include:

=over 4

=item subtests

Subtests were released in Test::More 0.94, which came with Perl 5.12.0. Subtests did not implicitly call C<done_testing()> until 0.96; the first Perl with that fix was Perl 5.14.0 with 0.98.

=item C<done_testing()>

This was released in Test::More 0.88 and first shipped with Perl in 5.10.1 as part of Test::More 0.92. 

=item C<cmp_ok()>

Although C<cmp_ok()> was introduced in 0.40, 0.86 fixed an important bug to make it safe for overloaded objects; the fixed first shipped with Perl in 5.10.1 as part of Test::More 0.92.

=item C<new_ok()> C<note()> and C<explain()>

These were was released in Test::More 0.82, and first shipped with Perl in 5.10.1 as part of Test::More 0.92.

There is a full version history in the Changes file, and the Test::More versions included as core can be found using L<Module::CoreList>:

    $ corelist -a Test::More


=head1 CAVEATS and NOTES

=over 4

=item utf8 / "Wide character in print"

If you use utf8 or other non-ASCII characters with Test::More you
might get a "Wide character in print" warning.  Using
C<< binmode STDOUT, ":utf8" >> will not fix it.
L<Test::Builder> (which powers
Test::More) duplicates STDOUT and STDERR.  So any changes to them,
including changing their output disciplines, will not be seen by
Test::More.

One work around is to apply encodings to STDOUT and STDERR as early
as possible and before Test::More (or any other Test module) loads.

    use open ':std', ':encoding(utf8)';
    use Test::More;

A more direct work around is to change the filehandles used by
L<Test::Builder>.

    my $builder = Test::More->builder;
    binmode $builder->output,         ":encoding(utf8)";
    binmode $builder->failure_output, ":encoding(utf8)";
    binmode $builder->todo_output,    ":encoding(utf8)";


=item Overloaded objects

String overloaded objects are compared B<as strings> (or in C<cmp_ok()>'s
case, strings or numbers as appropriate to the comparison op).  This
prevents Test::More from piercing an object's interface allowing
better blackbox testing.  So if a function starts returning overloaded
objects instead of bare strings your tests won't notice the
difference.  This is good.

However, it does mean that functions like C<is_deeply()> cannot be used to
test the internals of string overloaded objects.  In this case I would
suggest L<Test::Deep> which contains more flexible testing functions for
complex data structures.


=item Threads

Test::More will only be aware of threads if C<use threads> has been done
I<before> Test::More is loaded.  This is ok:

    use threads;
    use Test::More;

This may cause problems:

    use Test::More
    use threads;

5.8.1 and above are supported.  Anything below that has too many bugs.

=head1 HISTORY

This is a case of convergent evolution with Joshua Pritikin's L<Test>
module.  I was largely unaware of its existence when I'd first
written my own C<ok()> routines.  This module exists because I can't
figure out how to easily wedge test names into Test's interface (along
with a few other problems).

The goal here is to have a testing utility that's simple to learn,
quick to use and difficult to trip yourself up with while still
providing more flexibility than the existing Test.pm.  As such, the
names of the most common routines are kept tiny, special cases and
magic side-effects are kept to a minimum.  WYSIWYG.


=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2

=head2 ALTERNATIVES

L<Test2::Suite> is the most recent and modern set of tools for testing.

L<Test::Simple> if all this confuses you and you just want to write
some tests.  You can upgrade to Test::More later (it's forward
compatible).

L<Test::Legacy> tests written with Test.pm, the original testing
module, do not play well with other testing libraries.  Test::Legacy
emulates the Test.pm interface and does play well with others.

=head2 ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES

L<Test::Differences> for more ways to test complex data structures.
And it plays well with Test::More.

L<Test::Class> is like xUnit but more perlish.

L<Test::Deep> gives you more powerful complex data structure testing.

L<Test::Inline> shows the idea of embedded testing.

L<Mock::Quick> The ultimate mocking library. Easily spawn objects defined on
the fly. Can also override, block, or reimplement packages as needed.

L<Test::FixtureBuilder> Quickly define fixture data for unit tests.

=head2 OTHER COMPONENTS

L<Test::Harness> is the test runner and output interpreter for Perl.
It's the thing that powers C<make test> and where the C<prove> utility
comes from.

=head2 BUNDLES

L<Test::Most> Most commonly needed test functions and features.

=head1 NAME

Test::Simple - Basic utilities for writing tests.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Simple tests => 1;

  ok( $foo eq $bar, 'foo is bar' );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

** If you are unfamiliar with testing B<read L<Test::Tutorial> first!> **

This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing tests
suitable for CPAN modules and other pursuits.  If you wish to do more
complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement
for this one).

The basic unit of Perl testing is the ok.  For each thing you want to
test your program will print out an "ok" or "not ok" to indicate pass
or fail.  You do this with the C<ok()> function (see below).

The only other constraint is you must pre-declare how many tests you
plan to run.  This is in case something goes horribly wrong during the
test and your test program aborts, or skips a test or whatever.  You
do this like so:

    use Test::Simple tests => 23;

You must have a plan.


=over 4

=item B<ok>

  ok( $foo eq $bar, $name );
  ok( $foo eq $bar );

C<ok()> is given an expression (in this case C<$foo eq $bar>).  If it's
true, the test passed.  If it's false, it didn't.  That's about it.

C<ok()> prints out either "ok" or "not ok" along with a test number (it
keeps track of that for you).

  # This produces "ok 1 - Hell not yet frozen over" (or not ok)
  ok( get_temperature($hell) > 0, 'Hell not yet frozen over' );

If you provide a $name, that will be printed along with the "ok/not
ok" to make it easier to find your test when if fails (just search for
the name).  It also makes it easier for the next guy to understand
what your test is for.  It's highly recommended you use test names.

All tests are run in scalar context.  So this:

    ok( @stuff, 'I have some stuff' );

will do what you mean (fail if stuff is empty)

=cut

sub ok ($;$) {    ## no critic (Subroutines::ProhibitSubroutinePrototypes)
    return $CLASS->builder->ok(@_);
}

=back

Test::Simple will start by printing number of tests run in the form
"1..M" (so "1..5" means you're going to run 5 tests).  This strange
format lets L<Test::Harness> know how many tests you plan on running in
case something goes horribly wrong.

If all your tests passed, Test::Simple will exit with zero (which is
normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If
you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras)
will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Simple
will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after
having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be
considered a failure and will exit with 255.

So the exit codes are...

    0                   all tests successful
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

This module is by no means trying to be a complete testing system.
It's just to get you started.  Once you're off the ground its
recommended you look at L<Test::More>.


=head1 EXAMPLE

Here's an example of a simple .t file for the fictional Film module.

    use Test::Simple tests => 5;

    use Film;  # What you're testing.

    my $btaste = Film->new({ Title    => 'Bad Taste',
                             Director => 'Peter Jackson',
                             Rating   => 'R',
                             NumExplodingSheep => 1
                           });
    ok( defined($btaste) && ref $btaste eq 'Film',     'new() works' );

    ok( $btaste->Title      eq 'Bad Taste',     'Title() get'    );
    ok( $btaste->Director   eq 'Peter Jackson', 'Director() get' );
    ok( $btaste->Rating     eq 'R',             'Rating() get'   );
    ok( $btaste->NumExplodingSheep == 1,        'NumExplodingSheep() get' );

It will produce output like this:

    1..5
    ok 1 - new() works
    ok 2 - Title() get
    ok 3 - Director() get
    not ok 4 - Rating() get
    #   Failed test 'Rating() get'
    #   in t/film.t at line 14.
    ok 5 - NumExplodingSheep() get
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 5

Indicating the Film::Rating() method is broken.


=head1 CAVEATS

Test::Simple will only report a maximum of 254 failures in its exit
code.  If this is a problem, you probably have a huge test script.
Split it into multiple files.  (Otherwise blame the Unix folks for
using an unsigned short integer as the exit status).

Because VMS's exit codes are much, much different than the rest of the
universe, and perl does horrible mangling to them that gets in my way,
it works like this on VMS.

    0     SS$_NORMAL        all tests successful
    4     SS$_ABORT         something went wrong

Unfortunately, I can't differentiate any further.


=head1 NOTES

Test::Simple is B<explicitly> tested all the way back to perl 5.6.0.

Test::Simple is thread-safe in perl 5.8.1 and up.

=head1 HISTORY

This module was conceived while talking with Tony Bowden in his
kitchen one night about the problems I was having writing some really
complicated feature into the new Testing module.  He observed that the
main problem is not dealing with these edge cases but that people hate
to write tests B<at all>.  What was needed was a dead simple module
that took all the hard work out of testing and was really, really easy
to learn.  Paul Johnson simultaneously had this idea (unfortunately,
he wasn't in Tony's kitchen).  This is it.


=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item L<Test::More>

More testing functions!  Once you outgrow Test::Simple, look at
L<Test::More>.  Test::Simple is 100% forward compatible with L<Test::More>
(i.e. you can just use L<Test::More> instead of Test::Simple in your
programs and things will still work).
