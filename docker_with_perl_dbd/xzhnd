==============================================================================
VERSION 7.2					*version-7.2* *version7.2*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.1 and 7.2.

This is mostly a bug-fix release.  The main new feature is floating point
support. |Float|


Changed							*changed-7.2*
-------

Changed the command line buffer name from "command-line" to "[Command Line]".

Removed optional ! for ":caddexpr", ":cgetexpr", ":cgetfile", ":laddexpr",
":lgetexpr" and ":lgetfile".  They are not needed.  (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

An offset for syntax matches worked on bytes instead of characters.  That is
inconsistent and can easily be done wrong.  Use character offsets now.
(Yukihiro Nakadaira)

The FileChangedShellPost event was also given when a file didn't change.
(John Little)

When the current line is long (doesn't fit) the popup menu can't be seen.
Display it below the screen line instead of below the text line.
(Francois Ingelrest)

Switched to autoconf version 2.62.

Moved including fcntl.h to vim.h and removed it from all .c files.

Introduce macro STRMOVE(d, s), like STRCPY() for overlapping strings.
Use it instead of mch_memmove(p, p + x, STRLEN(p + x) + 1).

Removed the bulgarian.vim keymap file, two more standard ones replace it.
(Boyko Bantchev)

Increased the maximum number of tag matches for command line completion from
