  Fixed build using dmake on windows thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Fixed build on using some shells thanks to Gurusamy Sarathy.
  Fixed ParamValues to only be appended to ShowErrorStatement if not empty.
  Fixed $dbh->{Statement} not being writable by drivers in some cases.
  Fixed occasional undef warnings on connect failures thanks to Ed Avis.
  Fixed small memory leak when using $sth->{NAME..._hash}.
  Fixed 64bit warnings thanks to Marian Jancar.
  Fixed DBD::Proxy::db::DESTROY to not alter $@ thanks to Keith Chapman.
  Fixed Makefile.PL status from WriteMakefile() thanks to Leon Brocard.

  Changed "Can't set ...->{Foo}: unrecognised attribute" from an error to a
    warning when running with DBI::ProxyServer to simplify upgrades.
  Changed execute_array() to no longer require ArrayTupleStatus attribute.
  Changed DBI->available_drivers to not hide DBD::Sponge.
  Updated/moved placeholder docs to a better place thanks to Johan Vromans.
  Changed dbd_db_do4 api in Driver.xst to match dbd_st_execute (return int,
    not bool), relevant only to driver authors.
  Changed neat(), and thus trace(), so strings marked as utf8 are presented
    in double quotes instead of single quotes and are not sanitized.

  Added $dbh->data_sources method.
  Added $dbh->last_insert_id method.
  Added $sth->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status) method.
  Added DBI->installed_versions thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Added $DBI::Profile::ON_DESTROY_DUMP variable.
  Added docs for DBD::Sponge thanks to Mark Stosberg.

1.37 - 2003-05-15, Tim Bunce

  Fixed "Can't get dbh->{Statement}: unrecognised attribute" error in test
    caused by change to perl internals in 5.8.0
  Fixed to build with latest development perl (5.8.1@19525).
  Fixed C code to use all ANSI declarations thanks to Steven Lembark.

1.36 - 2003-05-11, Tim Bunce

  Fixed DBI->connect to carp instead of croak on 'old-style' usage.
  Fixed connect(,,, { RootClass => $foo }) to not croak if module not found.
  Fixed code generated by DBI::DBD::Metadata thanks to DARREN@cpan.org (#2270)
  Fixed DBI::PurePerl to not reset $@ during method dispatch.
  Fixed VMS build thanks to Michael Schwern.
  Fixed Proxy disconnect thanks to Steven Hirsch.
  Fixed error in DBI::DBD docs thanks to Andy Hassall.

  Changed t/40profile.t to not require Time::HiRes.
  Changed DBI::ProxyServer to load DBI only on first request, which
    helps threaded server mode, thanks to Bob Showalter.
  Changed execute_array() return value from row count to executed
    tuple count, and now the ArrayTupleStatus attribute is mandatory.
    NOTE: That is an API definition change that may affect your code.
  Changed CompatMode attribute to also disable attribute 'quick FETCH'.
  Changed attribute FETCH to be slightly faster thanks to Stas Bekman.

  Added workaround for perl bug #17575 tied hash nested FETCH
    thanks to Silvio Wanka.
  Added Username and Password attributes to connect(..., \%attr) and so
    also embedded in DSN like "dbi:Driver(Username=user,Password=pass):..."
    Username and Password can't contain ")", ",", or "=" characters.
    The predence is DSN first, then \%attr, then $user & $pass parameters,
    and finally the DBI_USER & DBI_PASS environment variables.
    The Username attribute is stored in the $dbh but the Password is not.
  Added ProxyServer HOWTO configure restrictions docs thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
  Added MaxRows attribute to selectcol_arrayref prompted by Wojciech Pietron.
  Added dump_handle as a method not just a DBI:: utility function.
  Added on-demand by-row data feed into execute_array() using code ref,
    or statement handle. For example, to insert from a select:
    $insert_sth->execute_array( { ArrayTupleFetch => $select_sth, ... } )
  Added warning to trace log when $h->{foo}=... is ignored due to
    invalid prefix (e.g., not 'private_').

1.35 - 2003-03-07, Tim Bunce

  Fixed memory leak in fetchrow_hashref introduced in DBI 1.33.
  Fixed various DBD::Proxy errors introduced in DBI 1.33.
  Fixed to ANSI C in dbd_dr_data_sources thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Fixed $h->can($method_name) to return correct code ref.
  Removed DBI::Format from distribution as it's now part of the
    separate DBI::Shell distribution by Tom Lowery.
  Updated DBI::DBD docs with a note about the CLONE method.
  Updated DBI::DBD docs thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Updated DBI::DBD::Metadata for perl 5.5.3 thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Added note to install_method docs about setup_driver() method.

1.34 - 2003-02-28, Tim Bunce

  Fixed DBI::DBD docs to refer to DBI::DBD::Metadata thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Fixed dbi_time() compile using BorlandC on Windows thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Fixed profile tests to do enough work to measure on Windows.
  Fixed disconnect_all() to not be required by drivers.

  Added $okay = $h->can($method_name) to check if a method exists.
  Added DBD::*::*->install_method($method_name, \%attr) so driver private
    methods can be 'installed' into the DBI dispatcher and no longer
    need to be called using $h->func(..., $method_name).

  Enhanced $dbh->clone() and documentation.
  Enhanced docs to note that dbi_time(), and thus profiling, is limited
    to only millisecond (seconds/1000) resolution on Windows.
  Removed old DBI::Shell from distribution and added Tom Lowery's improved
    version to the Bundle::DBI file.
  Updated minimum version numbers for modules in Bundle::DBI.

1.33 - 2003-02-27, Tim Bunce

  NOTE: Future versions of the DBI *will not* support perl 5.6.0 or earlier.
  : Perl 5.6.1 will be the minimum supported version.

  NOTE: The "old-style" connect: DBI->connect($database, $user, $pass, $driver);
  : has been deprecated for several years and will now generate a warning.
  : It will be removed in a later release. Please change any old connect() calls.

  Added $dbh2 = $dbh1->clone to make a new connection to the database
    that is identical to the original one. clone() can be called even after
    the original handle has been disconnected. See the docs for more details.

  Fixed merging of profile data to not sum DBIprof_FIRST_TIME values.
  Fixed unescaping of newlines in DBI::ProfileData thanks to Sam Tregar.
  Fixed Taint bug with fetchrow_hashref with help from Bradley Baetz.
  Fixed $dbh->{Active} for DBD::Proxy, reported by Bob Showalter.
  Fixed STORE to not clear error during nested DBI call,
    thanks to Tony Bowden for the report and helpful test case.
  Fixed DBI::PurePerl error clearing behaviour.
  Fixed dbi_time() and thus DBI::Profile on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
  Fixed problem that meant ShowErrorStatement could show wrong statement,
   thanks to Ron Savage for the report and test case.
  Changed Apache::DBI hook to check for $ENV{MOD_PERL} instead of
    $ENV{GATEWAY_INTERFACE} thanks to Ask Bjoern Hansen.
  No longer tries to dup trace logfp when an interpreter is being cloned.
  Database handles no longer inherit shared $h->err/errstr/state storage
    from their drivers, so each $dbh has it's own $h->err etc. values
    and is no longer affected by calls made on other dbh's.
    Now when a dbh is destroyed it's err/errstr/state values are copied
    up to the driver so checking $DBI::errstr still works as expected.

  Build / portability fixes:
    Fixed t/40profile.t to not use Time::HiRes.
    Fixed t/06attrs.t to not be locale sensitive, reported by Christian Hammers.
    Fixed sgi compiler warnings, reported by Paul Blake.
    Fixed build using make -j4, reported by Jonathan Leffler.
    Fixed build and tests under VMS thanks to Craig A. Berry.

  Documentation changes:
    Documented $high_resolution_time = dbi_time() function.
    Documented that bind_col() can take an attribute hash.
    Clarified documentation for ParamValues attribute hash keys.
    Many good DBI documentation tweaks from Jonathan Leffler,
      including a major update to the DBI::DBD driver author guide.
    Clarified that execute() should itself call finish() if it's
      called on a statement handle that's still active.
    Clarified $sth->{ParamValues}. Driver authors please note.
    Removed "NEW" markers on some methods and attributes and
      added text to each giving the DBI version it was added in,
      if it was added after DBI 1.21 (Feb 2002).

  Changes of note for authors of all drivers:
    Added SQL_DATA_TYPE, SQL_DATETIME_SUB, NUM_PREC_RADIX, and
      INTERVAL_PRECISION fields to docs for type_info_all. There were
      already in type_info(), but type_info_all() didn't specify the
      index values.  Please check and update your type_info_all() code.
    Added DBI::DBD::Metadata module that auto-generates your drivers
      get_info and type_info_all data and code, thanks mainly to
      Jonathan Leffler and Steffen Goeldner. If you've not implemented
      get_info and type_info_all methods and your database has an ODBC
      driver available then this will do all the hard work for you!
    Drivers should no longer pass Err, Errstr, or State to _new_drh
      or _new_dbh functions.
    Please check that you support the slightly modified behaviour of
      $sth->{ParamValues}, e.g., always return hash with keys if possible.

  Changes of note for authors of compiled drivers:
    Added dbd_db_login6 & dbd_st_finish3 prototypes thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
    All dbd_*_*() functions implemented by drivers must have a
      corresponding #define dbd_*_* <driver_prefix>_*_* otherwise
      the driver may not work with a future release of the DBI.

  Changes of note for authors of drivers which use Driver.xst:
    Some new method hooks have been added are are enabled by
      defining corresponding macros:
          $drh->data_sources()      - dbd_dr_data_sources
          $dbh->do()                - dbd_db_do4
    The following methods won't be compiled into the driver unless
      the corresponding macro has been #defined:
          $drh->disconnect_all()    - dbd_discon_all


1.32 - 2002-12-01, Tim Bunce

  Fixed to work with 5.005_03 thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (I've not tested it).
  Reenabled taint tests (accidentally left disabled) spotted by Bradley Baetz.
  Improved docs for FetchHashKeyName attribute thanks to Ian Barwick.
  Fixed core dump if fetchrow_hashref given bad argument (name of attribute
    with a value that wasn't an array reference), spotted by Ian Barwick.
  Fixed some compiler warnings thanks to David Wheeler.
  Updated Steven Hirsch's enhanced proxy work (seems I left out a bit).
  Made t/40profile.t tests more reliable, reported by Randy, who is part of
    the excellent CPAN testers team: http://testers.cpan.org/
    (Please visit, see the valuable work they do and, ideally, join in!)

1.31 - 2002-11-29, Tim Bunce

  The fetchall_arrayref method, when called with a $maxrows parameter,
    no longer gives an error if called again after all rows have been
    fetched. This simplifies application logic when fetching in batches.
    Also added batch-fetch while() loop example to the docs.
  The proxy now supports non-lazy (synchronous) prepare, positioned
    updates (for selects containing 'for update'), PlRPC config set
    via attributes, and accurate propagation of errors, all thanks
    to Steven Hirsch (plus a minor fix from Sean McMurray and doc
    tweaks from Michael A Chase).
  The DBI_AUTOPROXY env var can now hold the full dsn of the proxy driver
    plus attributes, like "dbi:Proxy(proxy_foo=>1):host=...".
  Added TaintIn & TaintOut attributes to give finer control over
    tainting thanks to Bradley Baetz.
  The RootClass attribute no longer ignores failure to load a module,
    but also doesn't try to load a module if the class already exists,
    with thanks to James FitzGibbon.
  HandleError attribute works for connect failures thanks to David Wheeler.
  The connect() RaiseError/PrintError message now includes the username.
  Changed "last handle unknown or destroyed" warning to be a trace message.
  Removed undocumented $h->event() method.
  Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.
  The CursorName attribute now defaults to undef and not an error.

  DBI::Profile changes:
    New DBI::ProfileDumper, DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache, and
    DBI::ProfileData modules (to manage the storage and processing
    of profile data), plus dbiprof program for analyzing profile
    data - with many thanks to Sam Tregar.
    Added $DBI::err (etc) tied variable lookup time to profile.
    Added time for DESTROY method into parent handles profile (used to be ignored).

  Documentation changes:
    Documented $dbh = $sth->{Database} attribute.
    Documented $dbh->connected(...) post-connection call when subclassing.
    Updated some minor doc issues thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
    Updated Makefile.PL example in DBI::DBD thanks to KAWAI,Takanori.
    Fixed execute_array() example thanks to Peter van Hardenberg.

  Changes for driver authors, not required but strongly recommended:
    Change DBIS to DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)   [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
    Change DBILOGFP to DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh) [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
    Any function from which all instances of DBIS and DBILOGFP are
    removed can also have dPERLINTERP removed (a good thing).
    All use of the DBIh_EVENT* macros should be removed.
    Major update to DBI::DBD docs thanks largely to Jonathan Leffler.
    Add these key values: 'Err' => \my $err, 'Errstr' => \my $errstr,
    to the hash passed to DBI::_new_dbh() in your driver source code.
    That will make each $dbh have it's own $h->err and $h->errstr
    values separate from other $dbh belonging to the same driver.
    If you have a ::db or ::st DESTROY methods that do nothing
    you can now remove them - which speeds up handle destruction.


1.30 - 2002-07-18, Tim Bunce

  Fixed problems with selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
    selectall_arrayref introduced in DBI 1.29.
  Fixed FETCHing a handle attribute to not clear $DBI::err etc (broken in 1.29).
  Fixed core dump at trace level 9 or above.
  Fixed compilation with perl 5.6.1 + ithreads (i.e. Windows).
  Changed definition of behaviour of selectrow_array when called in a scalar
    context to match fetchrow_array.
  Corrected selectrow_arrayref docs which showed selectrow_array thanks to Paul DuBois.

1.29 - 2002-07-15, Tim Bunce

  NOTE: This release changes the specified behaviour for the
  : fetchrow_array method when called in a scalar context:
  : The DBI spec used to say that it would return the FIRST field.
  : Which field it returns (i.e., the first or the last) is now undefined.
  : This does not affect statements that only select one column, which is
  : usually the case when fetchrow_array is called in a scalar context.
  : FYI, this change was triggered by discovering that the fetchrow_array
  : implementation in Driver.xst (used by most compiled drivers)
  : didn't match the DBI specification. Rather than change the code
  : to match, and risk breaking existing applications, I've changed the
  : specification (that part was always of dubious value anyway).

  NOTE: Future versions of the DBI may not support for perl 5.5 much longer.
  : If you are still using perl 5.005_03 you should be making plans to
  : upgrade to at least perl 5.6.1, or 5.8.0. Perl 5.8.0 is due to be
  : released in the next week or so.  (Although it's a "point 0" release,
  : it is the most thoroughly tested release ever.)

  Added XS/C implementations of selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
    selectall_arrayref to Driver.xst. See DBI 1.26 Changes for more info.
  Removed support for the old (fatally flawed) "5005" threading model.
  Added support for new perl 5.8 iThreads thanks to Gerald Richter.
    (Threading support and safety should still be regarded as beta
    quality until further notice. But it's much better than it was.)
  Updated the "Threads and Thread Safety" section of the docs.
  The trace output can be sent to STDOUT instead of STDERR by using
    "STDOUT" as the name of the file, i.e., $h->trace(..., "STDOUT")
  Added pointer to perlreftut, perldsc, perllol, and perlboot manuals
    into the intro section of the docs, suggested by Brian McCain.
  Fixed DBI::Const::GetInfo::* pod docs thanks to Zack Weinberg.
  Some changes to how $dbh method calls are treated by DBI::Profile:
    Meta-data methods now clear $dbh->{Statement} on entry.
    Some $dbh methods are now profiled as if $dbh->{Statement} was empty
    (because thet're unlikely to actually relate to its contents).
  Updated dbiport.h to ppport.h from perl 5.8.0.
  Tested with perl 5.5.3 (vanilla, Solaris), 5.6.1 (vanilla, Solaris), and
    perl 5.8.0 (RC3@17527 with iThreads & Multiplicity on Solaris and FreeBSD).

1.28 - 2002-06-14, Tim Bunce

  Added $sth->{ParamValues} to return a hash of the most recent
    values bound to placeholders via bind_param() or execute().
    Individual drivers need to be updated to support it.
  Enhanced ShowErrorStatement to include ParamValues if available:
    "DBD::foo::st execute failed: errstr [for statement ``...'' with params: 1='foo']"
  Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.

1.27 - 2002-06-13, Tim Bunce

  Fixed missing column in C implementation of fetchall_arrayref()
    thanks to Philip Molter for the prompt reporting of the problem.

1.26 - 2002-06-13, Tim Bunce

  Fixed t/40profile.t to work on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
  Fixed $h->{Profile} to return undef, not error, if not set.
  Fixed DBI->available_drivers in scalar context thanks to Michael Schwern.

  Added C implementations of selectrow_arrayref() and fetchall_arrayref()
    in Driver.xst.  All compiled drivers using Driver.xst will now be
    faster making those calls. Most noticeable with fetchall_arrayref for
    many rows or selectrow_arrayref with a fast query. For example, using
    DBD::mysql a selectrow_arrayref for a single row using a primary key
    is ~20% faster, and fetchall_arrayref for 20000 rows is twice as fast!
    Drivers just need to be recompiled and reinstalled to enable it.
    The fetchall_arrayref speed up only applies if $slice parameter is not used.
  Added $max_rows parameter to fetchall_arrayref() to optionally limit
    the number of rows returned. Can now fetch batches of rows.
  Added MaxRows attribute to selectall_arrayref()
    which then passes it to fetchall_arrayref().
  Changed selectrow_array to make use of selectrow_arrayref.
  Trace level 1 now shows first two parameters of all methods
    (used to only for that for some, like prepare,execute,do etc)
  Trace indicator for recursive calls (first char on trace lines)
    now starts at 1 not 2.

  Documented that $h->func() does not trigger RaiseError etc
    so applications must explicitly check for errors.
  DBI::Profile with DBI_PROFILE now shows percentage time inside DBI.
  HandleError docs updated to show that handler can edit error message.
  HandleError subroutine interface is now regarded as stable.

1.25 - 2002-06-05, Tim Bunce

  Fixed build problem on Windows and some compiler warnings.
  Fixed $dbh->{Driver} and $sth->{Statement} for driver internals
    These are 'inner' handles as per behaviour prior to DBI 1.16.
  Further minor improvements to DBI::PurePerl accuracy.

1.24 - 2002-06-04, Tim Bunce

  Fixed reference loop causing a handle/memory leak
    that was introduced in DBI 1.16.
  Fixed DBI::Format to work with 'filehandles' from IO::Scalar
    and similar modules thanks to report by Jeff Boes.
  Fixed $h->func for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Fixed $dbh->{Name} for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Dean Arnold.

  Added DBI method call profiling and benchmarking.
    This is a major new addition to the DBI.
    See $h->{Profile} attribute and DBI::Profile module.
    For a quick trial, set the DBI_PROFILE environment variable and
    run your favourite DBI script. Try it with DBI_PROFILE set to 1,
    then try 2, 4, 8, 10, and -10. Have fun!

  Added execute_array() and bind_param_array() documentation
    with thanks to Dean Arnold.
  Added notes about the DBI having not yet been tested with iThreads
    (testing and patches for SvLOCK etc welcome).
  Removed undocumented Handlers attribute (replaced by HandleError).
  Tested with 5.5.3 and 5.8.0 RC1.

1.23 - 2002-05-25, Tim Bunce

  Greatly improved DBI::PurePerl in performance and accuracy.
  Added more detail to DBI::PurePerl docs about what's not supported.
  Fixed undef warnings from t/15array.t and DBD::Sponge.

1.22 - 2002-05-22, Tim Bunce

  Added execute_array() and bind_param_array() with special thanks
    to Dean Arnold. Not yet documented. See t/15array.t for examples.
    All drivers now automatically support these methods.
  Added DBI::PurePerl, a transparent DBI emulation for pure-perl drivers
    with special thanks to Jeff Zucker. Perldoc DBI::PurePerl for details.
  Added DBI::Const::GetInfo* modules thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added write_getinfo_pm utility to DBI::DBD thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $allow_active==2 mode for prepare_cached() thanks to Stephen Clouse.

  Updated DBI::Format to Revision 11.4 thanks to Tom Lowery.
  Use File::Spec in Makefile.PL (helps VMS etc) thanks to Craig Berry.
  Extend $h->{Warn} to commit/rollback ineffective warning thanks to Jeff Baker.
  Extended t/preparse.t and removed "use Devel::Peek" thanks to Scott Hildreth.
  Only copy Changes to blib/lib/Changes.pm once thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Updated internals for modern perls thanks to Jonathan Leffler and Jeff Urlwin.
  Tested with perl 5.7.3 (just using default perl config).

  Documentation changes:

  Added 'Catalog Methods' section to docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Updated README thanks to Michael Schwern.
  Clarified that driver may choose not to start new transaction until
    next use of $dbh after commit/rollback.
  Clarified docs for finish method.
  Clarified potentials problems with prepare_cached() thanks to Stephen Clouse.


1.21 - 2002-02-07, Tim Bunce

  The minimum supported perl version is now 5.005_03.

  Fixed DBD::Proxy support for AutoCommit thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
  Fixed DBI::ProxyServer bind_param(_inout) handing thanks to Oleg Mechtcheriakov.
  Fixed DBI::ProxyServer fetch loop thanks to nobull@mail.com.
  Fixed install_driver do-the-right-thing with $@ on error. It, and connect(),
    will leave $@ empty on success and holding the error message on error.
    Thanks to Jay Lawrence, Gavin Sherlock and others for the bug report.
  Fixed fetchrow_hashref to assign columns to the hash left-to-right
    so later fields with the same name overwrite earlier ones
    as per DBI < 1.15, thanks to Kay Roepke.

  Changed tables() to use quote_indentifier() if the driver returns a
    true value for $dbh->get_info(29) # SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR
  Changed ping() so it no longer triggers RaiseError/PrintError.
  Changed connect() to not call $class->install_driver unless needed.
  Changed DESTROY to catch fatal exceptions and append to $@.

  Added ISO SQL/CLI & ODBCv3 data type definitions thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Removed the definition of SQL_BIGINT data type constant as the value is
    inconsistent between standards (ODBC=-5, SQL/CLI=25).
  Added $dbh->column_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $dbh->foreign_key_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $dbh->quote_identifier(...) insipred by Simon Oliver.
  Added $dbh->set_err(...) for DBD authors and DBI subclasses
    (actually been there for a while, now expanded and documented).
  Added $h->{HandleError} = sub { ... } addition and/or alternative
    to RaiseError/PrintError. See the docs for more info.
  Added $h->{TraceLevel} = N attribute to set/get trace level of handle
    thus can set trace level via an (eg externally specified) DSN
    using the embedded attribute syntax:
      $dsn = 'dbi:DB2(PrintError=1,TraceLevel=2):dbname';
    Plus, you can also now do: local($h->{TraceLevel}) = N;
    (but that leaks a little memory in some versions of perl).
  Added some call tree information to trace output if trace level >= 3
    With thanks to Graham Barr for the stack walking code.
  Added experimental undocumented $dbh->preparse(), see t/preparse.t
    With thanks to Scott T. Hildreth for much of the work.
  Added Fowler/Noll/Vo hash type as an option to DBI::hash().

  Documentation changes:

  Added DBI::Changes so now you can "perldoc DBI::Changes", yeah!
  Added selectrow_arrayref & selectrow_hashref docs thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Added 'Standards Reference Information' section to docs to gather
    together all references to relevant on-line standards.
  Added link to poop.sourceforge.net into the docs thanks to Dave Rolsky.
  Added link to hyperlinked BNF for SQL92 thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Added 'Subclassing the DBI' docs thanks to Stephen Clouse, and
    then changed some of them to reflect the new approach to subclassing.
  Added stronger wording to description of $h->{private_*} attributes.
  Added docs for DBI::hash.

  Driver API changes:

  Now a COPY of the DBI->connect() attributes is passed to the driver
    connect() method, so it can process and delete any elements it wants.
    Deleting elements reduces/avoids the explicit
      $dbh->{$_} = $attr->{$_} foreach keys %$attr;
    that DBI->connect does after the driver connect() method returns.


1.20 - 2001-08-24, Tim Bunce

  WARNING: This release contains two changes that may affect your code.
  : Any code using selectall_hashref(), which was added in March 2001, WILL
  : need to be changed. Any code using fetchall_arrayref() with a non-empty
  : hash slice parameter may, in a few rare cases, need to be changed.
  : See the change list below for more information about the changes.
  : See the DBI documentation for a description of current behaviour.

  Fixed memory leak thanks to Toni Andjelkovic.
  Changed fetchall_arrayref({ foo=>1, ...}) specification again (sorry):
    The key names of the returned hashes is identical to the letter case of
    the names in the parameter hash, regardless of the L</FetchHashKeyName>
    attribute. The letter case is ignored for matching.
  Changed fetchall_arrayref([...]) array slice syntax specification to
    clarify that the numbers in the array slice are perl index numbers
    (which start at 0) and not column numbers (which start at 1).
  Added { Columns=>... } and { Slice =>... } attributes to selectall_arrayref()
    which is passed to fetchall_arrayref() so it can fetch hashes now.
  Added a { Columns => [...] } attribute to selectcol_arrayref() so that
    the list it returns can be built from more than one column per row.
    Why? Consider my %hash = @{$dbh->selectcol_arrayref($sql,{ Columns=>[1,2]})}
    to return id-value pairs which can be used directly to build a hash.
  Added $hash_ref = $sth->fetchall_hashref( $key_field )
    which returns a ref to a hash with, typically, one element per row.
    $key_field is the name of the field to get the key for each row from.
    The value of the hash for each row is a hash returned by fetchrow_hashref.
  Changed selectall_hashref to return a hash ref (from fetchall_hashref)
    and not an array of hashes as it has since DBI 1.15 (end March 2001).
    WARNING: THIS CHANGE WILL BREAK ANY CODE USING selectall_hashref()!
    Sorry, but I think this is an important regularization of the API.
    To get previous selectall_hashref() behaviour (an array of hash refs)
    change $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_hashref( $statement, undef, @bind);
	to $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($statement, { Columns=>{} }, @bind);
  Added NAME_lc_hash, NAME_uc_hash, NAME_hash statement handle attributes.
    which return a ref to a hash of field_name => field_index (0..n-1) pairs.
  Fixed select_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Removed (unbundled) DBD::ADO and DBD::Multiplex from the DBI distribution.
    The latest versions of those modules are available from CPAN sites.
  Added $dbh->begin_work. This method causes AutoCommit to be turned
    off just until the next commit() or rollback().
    Driver authors: if the DBIcf_BegunWork flag is set when your commit or
    rollback method is called then please turn AutoCommit on and clear the
    DBIcf_BegunWork flag. If you don't then the DBI will but it'll be much
    less efficient and won't handle error conditions very cleanly.
  Retested on perl 5.4.4, but the DBI won't support 5.4.x much longer.
  Added text to SUPPORT section of the docs:
    For direct DBI and DBD::Oracle support, enhancement, and related work
    I am available for consultancy on standard commercial terms.
  Added text to ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section of the docs:
    Much of the DBI and DBD::Oracle was developed while I was Technical
    Director (CTO) of the Paul Ingram Group (www.ig.co.uk).  So I'd
    especially like to thank Paul for his generosity and vision in
    supporting this work for many years.

1.19 - 2001-07-20, Tim Bunce

  Made fetchall_arrayref({ foo=>1, ...}) be more strict to the specification
    in relation to wanting hash slice keys to be lowercase names.
    WARNING: If you've used fetchall_arrayref({...}) with a hash slice
    that contains keys with uppercase letters then your code will break.
    (As far as I recall the spec has always said don't do that.)

  Fixed 'Undefined value' warning and &sv_no output from neatsvpv/trace.
  Fixed small 'once per interpreter' leak.
  Assorted minor documentation fixes.

0.91 - 1997-12-10, Tim Bunce

  NOTE: This fix may break some existing scripts:
  DBI->connect("dbi:...",$user,$pass) was not setting AutoCommit and PrintError!
  DBI->connect(..., { ... }) no longer sets AutoCommit or PrintError twice.
  DBI->connect(..., { RaiseError=>1 }) now croaks if connect fails.

  Added better warning for bind_col(umns) where fields==0.
  Fixed to build okay with 5.004_54 with or without USE_THREADS.
  Note that the DBI has not been tested for thread safety yet.

0.90 - 1997-09-06, Tim Bunce

  Can once again be built with Perl 5.003.
  The DBI class can be subclassed more easily now.

  Slightly faster handle creation.
  Changed prototype for dbd_*_*_attrib() to add extra param.
  Note: 0.90, 0.89 and possibly some other recent versions have
  a small memory leak. This will be fixed in the next release.

0.89 - 1997-07-25, Tim Bunce

  Minor fix to neatsvpv (mainly used for debug trace) to workaround
  bug in perl where SvPV removes IOK flag from an SV.
  Minor updates to the docs.

0.88 - 1997-07-22, Tim Bunce

  Fixed build for perl5.003 and Win32 with Borland.
  Fixed documentation formatting.
  Fixed DBI_DSN ignored for old-style connect (with explicit driver).
  Fixed AutoCommit in DBD::ExampleP
  Fixed $h->trace.
  The DBI can now export SQL type values: use DBI ':sql_types';
  Modified Driver.xst and renamed DBDI.h to dbd_xsh.h

0.87 - 1997-07-18, Tim Bunce

  Fixed minor type clashes.
  Added more docs about placeholders and bind values.

0.86 - 1997-07-16, Tim Bunce

  Fixed failed connect causing 'unblessed ref' and other errors.
  Drivers must handle AutoCommit FETCH and STORE else DBI croaks.
  Added $h->{LongReadLen} and $h->{LongTruncOk} attributes for BLOBS.
  Added DBI_USER and DBI_PASS env vars. See connect docs for usage.
  Added DBI->trace() to set global trace level (like per-handle $h->trace).
  PERL_DBI_DEBUG env var renamed DBI_DEBUG (old name still works for now).
  Updated docs, including commit, rollback, AutoCommit and Transactions sections.
  Added bind_param method and execute(@bind_values) to docs.
  Fixed fetchall_arrayref.

  Since the DBIS structure has change the internal version numbers have also
  changed (DBIXS_VERSION == 9 and DBISTATE_VERSION == 9) so drivers will have
  to be recompiled. The test is also now more sensitive and the version
  mismatch error message now more clear about what to do. Old drivers are
  likely to core dump (this time) until recompiled for this DBI. In future
  DBI/DBD version mismatch will always produce a clear error message.

  Note that this DBI release contains and documents many new features
  that won't appear in drivers for some time. Driver writers might like
  to read perldoc DBI::DBD and comment on or apply the information given.

0.85 - 1997-06-25, Tim Bunce

  NOTE: New-style connect now defaults to AutoCommit mode unless
  { AutoCommit => 0 } specified in connect attributes. See the docs.
  AutoCommit attribute now defined and tracked by DBI core.
  Drivers should use/honour this and not implement their own.
  Added pod doc changes from Andreas and Jonathan.
  New DBI_DSN env var default for connect method. See docs.
  Documented the func method.
  Fixed "Usage: DBD::_::common::DESTROY" error.
  Fixed bug which set some attributes true when there value was fetched.
  Added new internal DBIc_set() macro for drivers to use.

0.84 - 1997-06-20, Tim Bunce

  Added $h->{PrintError} attribute which, if set true, causes all errors to
  trigger a warn().
  New-style DBI->connect call now automatically sets PrintError=1 unless
  { PrintError => 0 } specified in the connect attributes. See the docs.
  The old-style connect with a separate driver parameter is deprecated.
  Fixed fetchrow_hashref.
  Renamed $h->debug to $h->trace() and added a trace filename arg.
  Assorted other minor tidy-ups.

0.83 - 1997-06-11, Tim Bunce

  Added driver specification syntax to DBI->connect data_source
  parameter: DBI->connect('dbi:driver:...', $user, $passwd);
  The DBI->data_sources method should return data_source
  names with the appropriate 'dbi:driver:' prefix.
  DBI->connect will warn if \%attr is true but not a hash ref.
  Added the new fetchrow methods:
    @row_ary  = $sth->fetchrow_array;
    $ary_ref  = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref;
    $hash_ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;
  The old fetch and fetchrow methods still work.
  Driver implementors should implement the new names for
  fetchrow_array and fetchrow_arrayref ASAP (use the xs ALIAS:
  directive to define aliases for fetch and fetchrow).
  Fixed occasional problems with t/examp.t test.
  Added automatic errstr reporting to the debug trace output.
  Added the DBI FAQ from Alligator Descartes in module form for
  easy reading via "perldoc DBI::FAQ". Needs reformatting.
  Unknown driver specific attribute names no longer croak.
  Fixed problem with internal neatsvpv macro.

0.82 - 1997-05-23, Tim Bunce

  Added $h->{RaiseError} attribute which, if set true, causes all errors to
  trigger a die(). This makes it much easier to implement robust applications
  in terms of higher level eval { ... } blocks and rollbacks.
  Added DBI->data_sources($driver) method for implementation by drivers.
  The quote method now returns the string NULL (without quotes) for undef.
  Added VMS support thanks to Dan Sugalski.
  Added a 'quick start guide' to the README.
  Added neatsvpv function pointer to DBIS structure to make it available for
  use by drivers. A macro defines neatsvpv(sv,len) as (DBIS->neatsvpv(sv,len)).
  Old XS macro SV_YES_NO changes to standard boolSV.
