 The logsave program will execute cmd_prog with the specified
 argument(s), and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If the
 containing directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will
 accumulate the output in memory until it can be written out.  A copy
 of the output will also be written to standard output.

Description: macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Description: utility for directing compilation
 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

Provides: awk
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.29)
Description: Pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: List of standard media types and their usual file extension
 This package installs the configuration file /etc/mime.types, that lists
 standard media types (originally known as "MIME" types) and their usual file
 extension.  This provides a simple way for programs to have a first guess at a
 file's content.  On standard Debian desktop systems, one will also find more
 sophisticated tools, for instance provided by the "file" and "xdg-utils"
 packages.
 .
 The /etc/mime.types file is compiled by hand using mostly information provided
 by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

Description: easy-to-use, scalable distributed version control system
 Mercurial is a fast, lightweight Source Control Management system designed
 for efficient handling of very large distributed projects.
 .
 Its features include:
  * O(1) delta-compressed file storage and retrieval scheme
  * Complete cross-indexing of files and changesets for efficient exploration
    of project history
  * Robust SHA1-based integrity checking and append-only storage model
  * Decentralized development model with arbitrary merging between trees
  * High-speed HTTP-based network merge protocol
  * Easy-to-use command-line interface
  * Integrated stand-alone web interface
  * Small Python codebase
 .
 This package contains the architecture dependent files.
