/*
   gzlog provides a mechanism for frequently appending short strings to a gzip
   file that is efficient both in execution time and compression ratio.  The
   strategy is to write the short strings in an uncompressed form to the end of
   the gzip file, only compressing when the amount of uncompressed data has
   reached a given threshold.

   gzlog also provides protection against interruptions in the process due to
   system crashes.  The status of the operation is recorded in an extra field
   in the gzip file, and is only updated once the gzip file is brought to a
   valid state.  The last data to be appended or compressed is saved in an
   auxiliary file, so that if the operation is interrupted, it can be completed
   the next time an append operation is attempted.

   gzlog maintains another auxiliary file with the last 32K of data from the
   compressed portion, which is preloaded for the compression of the subsequent
   data.  This minimizes the impact to the compression ratio of appending.
 */

/*
   Operations Concept:

   Files (log name "foo"):
   foo.gz -- gzip file with the complete log
   foo.add -- last message to append or last data to compress
   foo.dict -- dictionary of the last 32K of data for next compression
   foo.temp -- temporary dictionary file for compression after this one
   foo.lock -- lock file for reading and writing the other files
   foo.repairs -- log file for log file recovery operations (not compressed)

   gzip file structure:
   - fixed-length (no file name) header with extra field (see below)
   - compressed data ending initially with empty stored block
   - uncompressed data filling out originally empty stored block and
     subsequent stored blocks as needed (16K max each)
   - gzip trailer
   - no junk at end (no other gzip streams)

   When appending data, the information in the first three items above plus the
   foo.add file are sufficient to recover an interrupted append operation.  The
   extra field has the necessary information to restore the start of the last
   stored block and determine where to append the data in the foo.add file, as
   well as the crc and length of the gzip data before the append operation.

   The foo.add file is created before the gzip file is marked for append, and
   deleted after the gzip file is marked as complete.  So if the append
   operation is interrupted, the data to add will still be there.  If due to
   some external force, the foo.add file gets deleted between when the append
   operation was interrupted and when recovery is attempted, the gzip file will
   still be restored, but without the appended data.

   When compressing data, the information in the first two items above plus the
   foo.add file are sufficient to recover an interrupted compress operation.
   The extra field has the necessary information to find the end of the
   compressed data, and contains both the crc and length of just the compressed
   data and of the complete set of data including the contents of the foo.add
   file.

   Again, the foo.add file is maintained during the compress operation in case
   of an interruption.  If in the unlikely event the foo.add file with the data
   to be compressed is missing due to some external force, a gzip file with
   just the previous compressed data will be reconstructed.  In this case, all
   of the data that was to be compressed is lost (approximately one megabyte).
   This will not occur if all that happened was an interruption of the compress
   operation.

   The third state that is marked is the replacement of the old dictionary with
   the new dictionary after a compress operation.  Once compression is
   complete, the gzip file is marked as being in the replace state.  This
   completes the gzip file, so an interrupt after being so marked does not
   result in recompression.  Then the dictionary file is replaced, and the gzip
   file is marked as completed.  This state prevents the possibility of
   restarting compression with the wrong dictionary file.

   All three operations are wrapped by a lock/unlock procedure.  In order to
   gain exclusive access to the log files, first a foo.lock file must be
   exclusively created.  When all operations are complete, the lock is
   released by deleting the foo.lock file.  If when attempting to create the
   lock file, it already exists and the modify time of the lock file is more
   than five minutes old (set by the PATIENCE define below), then the old
   lock file is considered stale and deleted, and the exclusive creation of
   the lock file is retried.  To assure that there are no false assessments
   of the staleness of the lock file, the operations periodically touch the
   lock file to update the modified date.

   Following is the definition of the extra field with all of the information
   required to enable the above append and compress operations and their
   recovery if interrupted.  Multi-byte values are stored little endian
   (consistent with the gzip format).  File pointers are eight bytes long.
   The crc's and lengths for the gzip trailer are four bytes long.  (Note that
   the length at the end of a gzip file is used for error checking only, and
   for large files is actually the length modulo 2^32.)  The stored block
   length is two bytes long.  The gzip extra field two-byte identification is
   "ap" for append.  It is assumed that writing the extra field to the file is
   an "atomic" operation.  That is, either all of the extra field is written
   to the file, or none of it is, if the operation is interrupted right at the
   point of updating the extra field.  This is a reasonable assumption, since
   the extra field is within the first 52 bytes of the file, which is smaller
   than any expected block size for a mass storage device (usually 512 bytes or
   larger).

   Extra field (35 bytes):
   - Pointer to first stored block length -- this points to the two-byte length
     of the first stored block, which is followed by the two-byte, one's
     complement of that length.  The stored block length is preceded by the
     three-bit header of the stored block, which is the actual start of the
     stored block in the deflate format.  See the bit offset field below.
   - Pointer to the last stored block length.  This is the same as above, but
     for the last stored block of the uncompressed data in the gzip file.
     Initially this is the same as the first stored block length pointer.
     When the stored block gets to 16K (see the MAX_STORE define), then a new
     stored block as added, at which point the last stored block length pointer
     is different from the first stored block length pointer.  When they are
     different, the first bit of the last stored block header is eight bits, or
     one byte back from the block length.
   - Compressed data crc and length.  This is the crc and length of the data
     that is in the compressed portion of the deflate stream.  These are used
     only in the event that the foo.add file containing the data to compress is
     lost after a compress operation is interrupted.
   - Total data crc and length.  This is the crc and length of all of the data
     stored in the gzip file, compressed and uncompressed.  It is used to
     reconstruct the gzip trailer when compressing, as well as when recovering
     interrupted operations.
   - Final stored block length.  This is used to quickly find where to append,
     and allows the restoration of the original final stored block state when
     an append operation is interrupted.
   - First stored block start as the number of bits back from the final stored
     block first length byte.  This value is in the range of 3..10, and is
     stored as the low three bits of the final byte of the extra field after
     subtracting three (0..7).  This allows the last-block bit of the stored
     block header to be updated when a new stored block is added, for the case
     when the first stored block and the last stored block are the same.  (When
     they are different, the numbers of bits back is known to be eight.)  This
     also allows for new compressed data to be appended to the old compressed
     data in the compress operation, overwriting the previous first stored
     block, or for the compressed data to be terminated and a valid gzip file
     reconstructed on the off chance that a compression operation was
     interrupted and the data to compress in the foo.add file was deleted.
   - The operation in process.  This is the next two bits in the last byte (the
     bits under the mask 0x18).  The are interpreted as 0: nothing in process,
     1: append in process, 2: compress in process, 3: replace in process.
   - The top three bits of the last byte in the extra field are reserved and
     are currently set to zero.

   Main procedure:
   - Exclusively create the foo.lock file using the O_CREAT and O_EXCL modes of
     the system open() call.  If the modify time of an existing lock file is
     more than PATIENCE seconds old, then the lock file is deleted and the
     exclusive create is retried.
   - Load the extra field from the foo.gz file, and see if an operation was in
     progress but not completed.  If so, apply the recovery procedure below.
   - Perform the append procedure with the provided data.
   - If the uncompressed data in the foo.gz file is 1MB or more, apply the
     compress procedure.
   - Delete the foo.lock file.

   Append procedure:
   - Put what to append in the foo.add file so that the operation can be
     restarted if this procedure is interrupted.
   - Mark the foo.gz extra field with the append operation in progress.
   + Restore the original last-block bit and stored block length of the last
     stored block from the information in the extra field, in case a previous
     append operation was interrupted.
   - Append the provided data to the last stored block, creating new stored
     blocks as needed and updating the stored blocks last-block bits and
     lengths.
   - Update the crc and length with the new data, and write the gzip trailer.
   - Write over the extra field (with a single write operation) with the new
     pointers, lengths, and crc's, and mark the gzip file as not in process.
     Though there is still a foo.add file, it will be ignored since nothing
     is in process.  If a foo.add file is leftover from a previously
     completed operation, it is truncated when writing new data to it.
   - Delete the foo.add file.

   Compress and replace procedures:
   - Read all of the uncompressed data in the stored blocks in foo.gz and write
     it to foo.add.  Also write foo.temp with the last 32K of that data to
     provide a dictionary for the next invocation of this procedure.
   - Rewrite the extra field marking foo.gz with a compression in process.
   * If there is no data provided to compress (due to a missing foo.add file
     when recovering), reconstruct and truncate the foo.gz file to contain
     only the previous compressed data and proceed to the step after the next
     one.  Otherwise ...
   - Compress the data with the dictionary in foo.dict, and write to the
     foo.gz file starting at the bit immediately following the last previously
     compressed block.  If there is no foo.dict, proceed anyway with the
     compression at slightly reduced efficiency.  (For the foo.dict file to be
     missing requires some external failure beyond simply the interruption of
     a compress operation.)  During this process, the foo.lock file is
     periodically touched to assure that that file is not considered stale by
     another process before we're done.  The deflation is terminated with a
     non-last empty static block (10 bits long), that is then located and
     written over by a last-bit-set empty stored block.
   - Append the crc and length of the data in the gzip file (previously
     calculated during the append operations).
   - Write over the extra field with the updated stored block offsets, bits
     back, crc's, and lengths, and mark foo.gz as in process for a replacement
     of the dictionary.
   @ Delete the foo.add file.
   - Replace foo.dict with foo.temp.
   - Write over the extra field, marking foo.gz as complete.

   Recovery procedure:
   - If not a replace recovery, read in the foo.add file, and provide that data
     to the appropriate recovery below.  If there is no foo.add file, provide
     a zero data length to the recovery.  In that case, the append recovery
     restores the foo.gz to the previous compressed + uncompressed data state.
     For the the compress recovery, a missing foo.add file results in foo.gz
     being restored to the previous compressed-only data state.
   - Append recovery:
     - Pick up append at + step above
   - Compress recovery:
     - Pick up compress at * step above
   - Replace recovery:
     - Pick up compress at @ step above
   - Log the repair with a date stamp in foo.repairs
