      master files in sync on all Debian systems. They comprise only "global
      static" ids: that is, those which are reserved globally for the
      benefit of packages which need to include files owned by those users
      or groups, or need the ids compiled into binaries. Since this
      reservation is a serious restriction, these ids must be allocated by
      the base-passwd maintainer on request. In general, packages should
      avoid requesting such ids where possible and instead allocate system
      users or groups dynamically. See Debian Policy for further details.
    </P
><P
>      The Debian Policy Manual reserves ranges for these global static users
      and groups, but it makes no attempt to allocate individual numbers or
      define their purposes. This document fills that gap by describing the
      purposes of the individual entries in these master files.
