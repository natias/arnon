See the DBI documentation for a complete discussion.

=head2 B<fetchall_hashref>

  $hash_ref = $sth->fetchall_hashref( $key_field );

Returns a hashref containing all rows to be fetched from the statement handle. See the DBI documentation for
a full discussion.

=head2 B<finish>

  $rv = $sth->finish;

Indicates to DBI that you are finished with the statement handle and are not going to use it again. Only needed
when you have not fetched all the possible rows.

=head2 B<rows>

  $rv = $sth->rows;

Returns the number of rows affected for updates, deletes and inserts and -1 for selects.

=head2 B<bind_col>

  $rv = $sth->bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind);
  $rv = $sth->bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind, \%attr );
  $rv = $sth->bind_col($column_number, \$var_to_bind, $bind_type );

Binds a Perl variable and/or some attributes to an output column of a SELECT statement.
Column numbers count up from 1. You do not need to bind output columns in order to fetch data.

NOTE: DBD::Oracle does not use the C<$bind_type> to determine how to
bind the column; it uses what Oracle says the data type is. You can
however set the StrictlyTyped/DiscardString attributes and these will
take effect as these attributes are applied after the column is
retrieved.

See the DBI documentation for a discussion of the optional parameters C<\%attr> and C<$bind_type>

=head2 B<bind_columns>

  $rv = $sth->bind_columns(@list_of_refs_to_vars_to_bind);

Calls the L</bind_col> method for each column in the SELECT statement, using the supplied list.

=head2 B<dump_results>

  $rows = $sth->dump_results($maxlen, $lsep, $fsep, $fh);

Fetches all the rows from the statement handle, calls C<DBI::neat_list> for each row, and
prints the results to C<$fh> (which defaults to F<STDOUT>). Rows are separated by C<$lsep> (which defaults
to a newline). Columns are separated by C<$fsep> (which defaults to a comma). The C<$maxlen> controls
how wide the output can be, and defaults to 35.

This method is designed as a handy utility for prototyping and testing queries. Since it uses
"neat_list" to format and edit the string for reading by humans, it is not recommended
for data transfer applications.

=head1 STATEMENT HANDLE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<NUM_OF_FIELDS> (integer, read-only)

Returns the number of columns returned by the current statement. A number will only be returned for
SELECT statements for INSERT,
UPDATE, and DELETE statements which contain a RETURNING clause.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<NUM_OF_PARAMS> (integer, read-only)

Returns the number of placeholders in the current statement.

=head2 B<NAME> (arrayref, read-only)

Returns an arrayref of column names for the current statement. This
method will only work for SELECT statements, for SHOW statements, and for
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements which contain a RETURNING clause.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<NAME_lc> (arrayref, read-only)

The same as the C<NAME> attribute, except that all column names are forced to lower case.

=head2 B<NAME_uc>  (arrayref, read-only)

The same as the C<NAME> attribute, except that all column names are forced to upper case.

=head2 B<NAME_hash> (hashref, read-only)

Similar to the C<NAME> attribute, but returns a hashref of column names instead of an arrayref. The names of the columns
are the keys of the hash, and the values represent the order in which the columns are returned, starting at 0.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<NAME_lc_hash> (hashref, read-only)

The same as the C<NAME_hash> attribute, except that all column names are forced to lower case.

=head2 B<NAME_uc_hash> (hashref, read-only)

The same as the C<NAME_hash> attribute, except that all column names are forced to lower case.

=head2 B<TYPE> (arrayref, read-only)

Returns an arrayref indicating the data type for each column in the statement.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<PRECISION> (arrayref, read-only)

Returns an arrayref of integer values for each column returned by the statement.
The number indicates the precision for C<NUMERIC> columns, the size in number of
characters for C<CHAR> and C<VARCHAR> columns, and for all other types of columns
it returns the number of I<bytes>.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<SCALE> (arrayref, read-only)

Returns an arrayref of integer values for each column returned by the statement. The number
indicates the scale of the that column. The only type that will return a value is C<NUMERIC>.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<NULLABLE> (arrayref, read-only)

Returns an arrayref of integer values for each column returned by the statement. The number
indicates if the column is nullable or not. 0 = not nullable, 1 = nullable, 2 = unknown.
This method returns undef if called before C<execute()>.

=head2 B<Database> (dbh, read-only)

Returns the database handle this statement handle was created from.

=head2 B<ParamValues> (hash ref, read-only)

Returns a reference to a hash containing the values currently bound to placeholders. If the "named parameters"
type of placeholders are being used (such as ":foo"), then the keys of the hash will be the names of the
placeholders (without the colon). If the "dollar sign numbers" type of placeholders are being used, the keys of the hash will
be the numbers, without the dollar signs. If the "question mark" type is used, integer numbers will be returned,
starting at one and increasing for every placeholder.

If this method is called before L</execute>, the literal values passed in are returned. If called after
L</execute>, then the quoted versions of the values are returned.

=head2 B<ParamTypes> (hash ref, read-only)

Returns a reference to a hash containing the type names currently bound to placeholders. The keys
are the same as returned by the ParamValues method. The values are hashrefs containing a single key value
pair, in which the key is either 'TYPE' if the type has a generic SQL equivalent, and 'pg_type' if the type can
only be expressed by a Postgres type. The value is the internal number corresponding to the type originally
passed in. (Placeholders that have not yet been bound will return undef as the value). This allows the output of
ParamTypes to be passed back to the L</bind_param> method.

=head2 B<Statement> (string, read-only)

Returns the statement string passed to the most recent "prepare" method called in this database handle, even if that method
failed. This is especially useful where "RaiseError" is enabled and the exception handler checks $@ and sees that a C<prepare>
method call failed.

=head2 B<RowsInCache>

Returns the number of un-fetched rows in the cache for selects.

=head1 SCROLLABLE CURSORS

Oracle supports the concept of a 'Scrollable Cursor' which is defined as a 'Result Set' where
the rows can be fetched either sequentially or non-sequentially. One can fetch rows forward,
backwards, from any given position or the n-th row from the current position in the result set.

Rows are numbered sequentially starting at one and client-side caching of the partial or entire result set
can improve performance by limiting round trips to the server.

Oracle does not support DML type operations with scrollable cursors so you are limited
to simple 'Select' operations only. As well you can not use this functionality with remote
mapped queries or if the LONG datatype is part of the select list.

However, LOBSs, CLOBSs, and BLOBs do work as do all the regular bind, and fetch methods.

Only use scrollable cursors if you really have a good reason to. They do use up considerable
more server and client resources and have poorer response times than non-scrolling cursors.

=head2 Enabling Scrollable Cursors

To enable this functionality you must first import the 'Fetch Orientation' and the 'Execution Mode' constants by using;

   use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_fetch_orient :ora_exe_modes);

Next you will have to tell DBD::Oracle that you will be using scrolling by setting the ora_exe_mode attribute on the
statement handle to 'OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY' with the prepare method;

  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_exe_mode=>OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY});

When the statement is executed you will then be able to use 'ora_fetch_scroll' method to get a row
or you can still use any of the other fetch methods but with a poorer response time than if you used a
non-scrolling cursor. As well scrollable cursors are compatible with any applicable bind methods.

=head2 Scrollable Cursor Methods

The following driver-specific methods are used with scrollable cursors.

=over

=item ora_scroll_position

  $position =  $sth->ora_scroll_position();

This method returns the current position (row number) attribute of the result set. Prior to the first fetch this value is 0. This is the only time
this value will be 0 after the first fetch the value will be set, so you can use this value to test if any rows have been fetched.
The minimum value will always be 1 after the first fetch. The maximum value will always be the total number of rows in the record set.

=item ora_fetch_scroll

  $ary_ref = $sth->ora_fetch_scroll($fetch_orient,$fetch_offset);

Works the same as C<fetchrow_arrayref>, excepts one passes in a 'Fetch Orientation' constant and a fetch_offset
value which will then determine the row that will be fetched. It returns the row as a list containing the field values.
Null fields are returned as I<undef> values in the list.

The valid orientation constant and fetch offset values combination are detailed below

  OCI_FETCH_CURRENT,  fetches the current row, the fetch offset value is ignored.
  OCI_FETCH_NEXT,     fetches the next row from the current position, the fetch offset value
                      is ignored.
  OCI_FETCH_FIRST,    fetches the first row, the fetch offset value is ignored.
  OCI_FETCH_LAST,     fetches the last row, the fetch offset value is ignored.
  OCI_FETCH_PRIOR,    fetches the previous row from the current position, the fetch offset
                      value is ignored.

  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, fetches the row that is specified by the fetch offset value.

  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, and a fetch offset value of 1 is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_FIRST.
  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, and a fetch offset value of 0 is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.

  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, fetches the row relative from the current position as specified by the
                      fetch offset value.

  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value of 0 is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value of 1 is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_NEXT.
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value of -1 is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_PRIOR.

The effect that a ora_fetch_scroll method call has on the current position attribute is detailed below.

  OCI_FETCH_CURRENT, has no effect on the current position attribute.
  OCI_FETCH_NEXT,    increments current position attribute by 1
  OCI_FETCH_NEXT,    when at the last row in the record set does not change current position
                     attribute, it is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT
  OCI_FETCH_FIRST,   sets the current position attribute to 1.
  OCI_FETCH_LAST,    sets the current position attribute to the total number of rows in the
                     record set.
  OCI_FETCH_PRIOR,   decrements current position attribute by 1.
  OCI_FETCH_PRIOR,   when at the first row in the record set does not change current position
                     attribute, it is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.

  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, sets the current position attribute to the fetch offset value.
  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, and a fetch offset value that is less than 1 does not change
                      current position attribute, it is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, and a fetch offset value that is greater than the number of records in
                      the record set, does not change current position attribute, it is
                      equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, sets the current position attribute to (current position attribute +
                      fetch offset value).
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value that makes the current position less than 1,
                      does not change fetch offset value so it is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value that makes it greater than the number of records
                      in the record set, does not change fetch offset value so it is equivalent
                      to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.

The effects of the differing orientation constants on the first fetch (current position attribute at 0) are as follows.

  OCI_FETCH_CURRENT, dose not fetch a row or change the current position attribute.
  OCI_FETCH_FIRST,   fetches row 1 and sets the current position attribute to 1.
  OCI_FETCH_LAST,    fetches the last row in the record set and sets the current position
                     attribute to the total number of rows in the record set.
  OCI_FETCH_NEXT,    equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_FIRST.
  OCI_FETCH_PRIOR,   equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.

  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, and a fetch offset value that is less than 1 is equivalent to a
                      OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE, and a fetch offset value that is greater than the number of
                      records in the record set is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value that is less than 1 is equivalent
                      to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.
  OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE, and a fetch offset value that makes it greater than the number
                      of records in the record set, is equivalent to a OCI_FETCH_CURRENT.

=head2 Scrollable Cursor Usage

Given a simple code like this:

  use DBI;
  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types :ora_fetch_orient :ora_exe_modes);
  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $dbuser, '');
  my $SQL = "select id,
                     first_name,
                     last_name
                from employee";
  my $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_exe_mode=>OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY});
  $sth->execute();
  my $value;

and one assumes that the number of rows returned from the query is 20, the code snippets below will illustrate the use of ora_fetch_scroll
method;

=over

=item Fetching the Last Row

  $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_LAST,0);
  print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute to will be 20 after this snippet.  This is also a way to get the number of rows in the record set, however,
if the record set is large this could take some time.

=item Fetching the Current Row

  $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_CURRENT,0);
  print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will still be 20 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the First Row

  $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_FIRST,0);
  print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 1 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the Next Row

  for(my $i=0;$i<=3;$i++){
     $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_NEXT,0);
     print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  }
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 5 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the Prior Row

  for(my $i=0;$i<=3;$i++){
     $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_PRIOR,0);
     print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  }
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 1 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the 10th Row

  $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE,10);
  print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 10 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the 10th to 14th Row

  for(my $i=10;$i<15;$i++){
      $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE,$i);
      print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  }
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 14 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the 14th to 10th Row

  for(my $i=14;$i>9;$i--){
    $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTE,$i);
    print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  }
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 10 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the 5th Row From the Present Position.

  $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE,5);
  print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 15 after this snippet.

=item Fetching the 9th Row Prior From the Present Position

  $value =  $sth->ora_fetch_scroll(OCI_FETCH_RELATIVE,-9);
  print "id=".$value->[0].", First Name=".$value->[1].", Last Name=".$value->[2]."\n";
  print "current scroll position=".$sth->ora_scroll_position()."\n";

The current position attribute will be 6 after this snippet.

=item Use Finish

  $sth->finish();

When using scrollable cursors it is required that you use the $sth->finish() method when you are done with the cursor as this type of
cursor has to be explicitly cancelled on the server. If you do not do this you may cause resource problems on your database.

=head1 LOBS AND LONGS

The key to working with LOBs (CLOB, BLOBs) is to remember the value of an Oracle LOB column is not the content of the LOB. It's a
'LOB Locator' which, after being selected or inserted needs extra processing to read or write the content of the LOB. There are also legacy LONG types (LONG, LONG RAW)
which are presently deprecated by Oracle but are still in use.  These LONG types do not utilize a 'LOB Locator' and also are more limited in
functionality than CLOB or BLOB fields.

DBD::Oracle now offers three interfaces to LOB and LONG data,

=over

=item L</Data Interface for Persistent LOBs>

With this interface DBD::Oracle handles your data directly utilizing regular OCI calls, Oracle itself takes care of the LOB Locator operations in the case of
BLOBs and CLOBs treating them exactly as if they were the same as the legacy LONG or LONG RAW types.

=item L</Data Interface for LOB Locators>

With this interface DBD::Oracle handles your data utilizing LOB Locator OCI calls so it only works with CLOB and BLOB datatypes. With this interface DBD::Oracle takes care of the LOB Locator operations for you.

=item LOB Locator Method Interface

This allows the user direct access to the LOB Locator methods, so you have to take care of the LOB Locator operations yourself.

=back

Generally speaking the interface that you will chose will be dependent on what end you are trying to achieve. All have their benefits and
drawbacks.

One point to remember when working with LOBs (CLOBs, BLOBs) is if your LOB column can be in one of three states;

=over

=item NULL

The table cell is created, but the cell holds no locator or value.
If your LOB field is in this state then there is no LOB Locator that DBD::Oracle can work so if your encounter a

  DBD::Oracle::db::ora_lob_read: locator is not of type OCILobLocatorPtr

error when working with a LOB.

You can correct this by using an SQL UPDATE statement to reset the LOB column to a non-NULL (or empty LOB) value with either EMPTY_BLOB or EMPTY_CLOB as in this example;

  UPDATE lob_example
     SET bindata=EMPTY_BLOB()
   WHERE bindata IS NULL.

=item Empty

A LOB instance with a locator exists in the cell, but it has no value. The length of the LOB is zero. In this case DBD::Oracle will return 'undef' for the field.

=item Populated

A LOB instance with a locator and a value exists in the cell. You actually get the LOB value.

=back

=head2 Data Interface for Persistent LOBs

This is the original interface for LONG and LONG RAW datatypes and from Oracle 9iR1 and later the OCI API was extended to work directly with the other LOB datatypes.
In other words you can treat all LOB type data (BLOB, CLOB) as if it was a LONG, LONG RAW, or VARCHAR2. So you can perform INSERT, UPDATE, fetch, bind, and define operations on LOBs using the same techniques
you would use on other datatypes that store character or binary data. In some cases there are fewer round trips to the server as no 'LOB Locators' are
used, normally one can get an entire LOB is a single round trip.

=head3 Simple Fetch for LONGs and LONG RAWs

As the name implies this is the simplest way to use this interface. DBD::Oracle just attempts to get your LONG datatypes as a single large piece.
There are no special settings, simply set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be larger than the expected size of the LONG or LONG RAW.
If the size of the LONG or LONG RAW exceeds 'LongReadLen' DBD::Oracle will return an 'ORA-24345: A Truncation' error.  To stop this set the database handle's 'LongTruncOk' attribute to '1'.
The maximum value of 'LongReadLen' seems to be dependent on the physical memory limits of the box that Oracle is running on.  You have most likely reached this limit if you run into
an 'ORA-01062: unable to allocate memory for define buffer' error.  One solution is to set the size of 'LongReadLen' to a lower value.

For example give this table;

  CREATE TABLE test_long (
              id NUMBER,
            long1 long)

this code;

  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 2*1024*1024; #2 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,long1 from test_long';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL);
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$long )=$sth->fetchrow()){
    print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
    print "long=".$long."\n";
  }

Will select out all of the long1 fields in the table as long as they are all under 2MB in length. A value in long1 longer than this will throw an error. Adding this line;

  $dbh->{LongTruncOk}=1;

before the execute will return all the long1 fields but they will be truncated at 2MBs.

=head3 Using ora_ncs_buff_mtpl

When getting CLOBs and NCLOBs in or out of Oracle, the Server will translate from the Server's NCharSet to the
Client's. If they happen to be the same or at least compatible then all of these actions are a 1 char to 1 char bases.
Thus if you set your LongReadLen buffer to 10_000_000 you will get up to 10_000_000 char.

However if the Server has to translate from one NCharSet to another it will use bytes for conversion. The buffer
value is set to 4 * LONG_READ_LEN which was very wasteful as you might only be asking for 10_000_000 bytes
but you were actually using 40_000_000 bytes of buffer under the hood.  You would still get 10_000_000 bytes
(maybe less characters though) but you are using allot more memory that you need.

You can now customize the size of the buffer by setting the 'ora_ncs_buff_mtpl' either on the connection or statement handle. You can
also set this as 'ORA_DBD_NCS_BUFFER' OS environment variable so you will have to go back and change all your code if you are getting into trouble.

The default value is still set to 4 for backward compatibility. You can lower this value and thus increase the amount of data you can retrieve. If the
ora_ncs_buff_mtpl is too small DBD::Oracle will throw and error telling you to increase this buffer by one.

If the error is not captured then you may get at some random point later on, usually at a finish() or disconnect() or even a fetch() this error;

  ORA-03127: no new operations allowed until the active operation ends

This is one of the more obscure ORA errors (have some fun and report it to Meta-Link they will scratch their heads for hours)

If you get this, simply increment the ora_ncs_buff_mtpl by one until it goes away.

This should greatly increase your ability to select very large CLOBs or NCLOBs, by freeing up a large block of memory.

You can tune this value by setting ora_oci_success_warn which will display the following

  OCILobRead field 2 of 3 SUCCESS: csform 1 (SQLCS_IMPLICIT), LOBlen 10240(characters), LongReadLen
  20(characters), BufLen 80(characters), Got 28(characters)

In the case above the query Got 28 characters (well really only 20 characters of 28 bytes) so we could use ora_ncs_buff_mtpl=>2 (20*2=40) thus saving 40bytes of memory.

=head3 Simple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs

To use this interface for the CLOB and BLOB datatypes set the 'ora_pers_lob' attribute of the statement handle to '1' with the prepare method, and
set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be larger than the expected size of the LOB. If the size of the LOB exceeds
'LongReadLen' DBD::Oracle will return an 'ORA-24345: A Truncation' error.  To stop this set the database handle's 'LongTruncOk' attribute to '1'.
The maximum value of 'LongReadLen' seems to be dependent on the physical memory limits of the box that Oracle is running on in the same way that LONGs and LONG RAWs are.

For CLOBs and NCLOBs the limit is 64k chars if there is no truncation. This is an internal OCI limit--complain to them if you want it changed.  However if your CLOB is longer than this
and also larger than 'LongReadLen' then 'LongReadLen' chars are returned.

It seems with BLOBs you are not limited by the 64k.

For example give this table;

  CREATE TABLE test_lob (id NUMBER,
               clob1 CLOB,
               clob2 CLOB,
               blob1 BLOB,
               blob2 BLOB)

this code;

  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 2*1024*1024; #2 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,lob_1,lob_2,blob_2 from test_lobs';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_pers_lob=>1});
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$log,$log2,$log3,$log4 )=$sth->fetchrow()){
    print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
    print "clob1=".$clob1."\n";
    print "clob2=".$clob2."\n";
    print "blob1=".$blob2."\n";
    print "blob2=".$blob2."\n";
  }

Will select out all of the LOBs in the table as long as they are all under 2MB in length. Longer lobs will throw an error. Adding this line;

  $dbh->{LongTruncOk}=1;

before the execute will return all the lobs but they will be truncated at 2MBs.

=head3 Piecewise Fetch with Callback

With a piecewise callback fetch DBD::Oracle sets up a function that will 'callback' to the DB during the fetch and gets your LOB (LONG, LONG RAW, CLOB, BLOB) piece by piece.
To use this interface set the 'ora_clbk_lob' attribute of the statement handle to '1' with the prepare method. Next set the 'ora_piece_size' to the size of the piece that
you want to return on the callback. Finally set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be larger than the expected
size of the LOB. Like the L</Simple Fetch for LONGs and LONG RAWs> and L</Simple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs> the if the size of the LOB exceeds 'LongReadLen' you can use the 'LongTruncOk' attribute to truncate the LOB
or set 'LongReadLen' to a higher value.  With this interface the value of 'ora_piece_size' seems to be constrained by the same memory limit as found on
the Simple Fetch interface. If you encounter an 'ORA-01062' error try setting the value of 'ora_piece_size' to a smaller value.   The value for 'LongReadLen' is
dependent on the version and settings of the Oracle DB you are using. In theory it ranges from 8GBs
in 9iR1 up to 128 terabytes with 11g but you will also be limited by the physical memory of your PERL instance.

Using the table from the last example this code;

  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 20*1024*1024; #20 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,lob_1,lob_2,blob_2 from test_lobs';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_clbk_lob=>1,ora_piece_size=>5*1024*1024});
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$log,$log2,$log3,$log4 )=$sth->fetchrow()){
    print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
    print "clob1=".$clob1."\n";
    print "clob2=".$clob2."\n";
    print "blob1=".$blob2."\n";
    print "blob2=".$blob2."\n";
  }

Will select out all of the LOBs in the table as long as they are all under 20MB in length. If the LOB is longer than 5MB (ora_piece_size) DBD::Oracle will fetch it in at least 2 pieces to a
maximum of 4 pieces (4*5MB=20MB). Like the Simple Fetch examples Lobs longer than 20MB will throw an error.

Using the table from the first example (LONG) this code;

  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 20*1024*1024; #2 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,long1 from test_long';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_clbk_lob=>1,ora_piece_size=>5*1024*1024});
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$long )=$sth->fetchrow()){
    print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
    print "long=".$long."\n";
  }

Will select all of the long1 fields from table as long as they are is under 20MB in length. If the long1 filed is longer than 5MB (ora_piece_size) DBD::Oracle will fetch it in at least 2 pieces to a
maximum of 4 pieces (4*5MB=20MB). Like the other examples long1 fields longer than 20MB will throw an error.

=head4 Piecewise Fetch with Polling

With a polling piecewise fetch DBD::Oracle iterates (Polls) over the LOB during the fetch getting your LOB (LONG, LONG RAW, CLOB, BLOB) piece by piece. To use this interface set the 'ora_piece_lob'
attribute of the statement handle to '1' with the prepare method. Next set the 'ora_piece_size' to the size of the piece that
you want to return on the callback. Finally set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a value that will be larger than the expected
size of the LOB. Like the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback> and Simple Fetches if the size of the LOB exceeds 'LongReadLen' you can use the 'LongTruncOk' attribute to truncate the LOB
or set 'LongReadLen' to a higher value.  With this interface the value of 'ora_piece_size' seems to be constrained by the same memory limit as found on
the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback>.

Using the table from the example above this code;

  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 20*1024*1024; #20 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,lob_1,lob_2,blob_2 from test_lobs';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_piece_lob=>1,ora_piece_size=>5*1024*1024});
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$log,$log2,$log3,$log4 )=$sth->fetchrow()){
    print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
    print "clob1=".$clob1."\n";
    print "clob2=".$clob2."\n";
    print "blob1=".$blob2."\n";
    print "blob2=".$blob2."\n";
  }

Will select out all of the LOBs in the table as long as they are all under 20MB in length. If the LOB is longer than 5MB (ora_piece_size) DBD::Oracle will fetch it in at least 2 pieces to a
maximum of 4 pieces (4*5MB=20MB). Like the other fetch methods LOBs longer than 20MB will throw an error.

Finally with this code;

  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 20*1024*1024; #2 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,long1 from test_long';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_piece_lob=>1,ora_piece_size=>5*1024*1024});
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$long )=$sth->fetchrow()){
    print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
    print "long=".$long."\n";
  }

Will select all of the long1 fields from table as long as they are is under 20MB in length. If the long1 field is longer than 5MB (ora_piece_size) DBD::Oracle will fetch it in at least 2 pieces to a
maximum of 4 pieces (4*5MB=20MB). Like the other examples long1 fields longer than 20MB will throw an error.

=head3 Binding for Updates and Inserts for CLOBs and  BLOBs

To bind for updates and inserts all that is required to use this interface is to set the statement handle's prepare method
'ora_type' attribute to 'SQLT_CHR' in the case of CLOBs and NCLOBs or 'SQLT_BIN' in the case of BLOBs as in this example for an insert;

  my $in_clob = "<document>\n";
  $in_clob .= "  <value>$_</value>\n" for 1 .. 10_000;
  $in_clob .= "</document>\n";
  my $in_blob ="0101" for 1 .. 10_000;

  $SQL='insert into test_lob3@tpgtest (id,clob1,clob2, blob1,blob2) values(?,?,?,?,?)';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL );
  $sth->bind_param(1,3);
  $sth->bind_param(2,$in_clob,{ora_type=>SQLT_CHR});
  $sth->bind_param(3,$in_clob,{ora_type=>SQLT_CHR});
  $sth->bind_param(4,$in_blob,{ora_type=>SQLT_BIN});
  $sth->bind_param(5,$in_blob,{ora_type=>SQLT_BIN});
  $sth->execute();

So far the only limit reached with this form of insert is the LOBs must be under 2GB in size.

=head3 Support for Remote LOBs;

Starting with Oracle 10gR2 the interface for Persistent LOBs was expanded to support remote LOBs (access over a dblink). Given a database called 'lob_test' that has a 'LINK' defined like this;

  CREATE DATABASE LINK link_test CONNECT TO test_lobs IDENTIFIED BY tester USING 'lob_test';

to a remote database called 'test_lobs', the following code will work;

  $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:Oracle:','test@lob_test','test');
  $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 2*1024*1024; #2 meg
  $SQL='select p_id,lob_1,lob_2,blob_2 from test_lobs@link_test';
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_pers_lob=>1});
  $sth->execute();
  while (my ( $p_id,$log,$log2,$log3,$log4 )=$sth->fetchrow()){
     print "p_id=".$p_id."\n";
     print "clob1=".$clob1."\n";
     print "clob2=".$clob2."\n";
     print "blob1=".$blob2."\n";
     print "blob2=".$blob2."\n";
  }

Below are the limitations of Remote LOBs;

=over

=item Queries involving more than one database are not supported;

so the following returns an error:

  SELECT t1.lobcol,
           a2.lobcol
    FROM t1,
         t2.lobcol@dbs2 a2 W
   WHERE LENGTH(t1.lobcol) = LENGTH(a2.lobcol);

as does:

     SELECT t1.lobcol
       FROM t1@dbs1
  UNION ALL
     SELECT t2.lobcol
       FROM t2@dbs2;

=item DDL commands are not supported;

so the following returns an error:

  CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT lob_col FROM tab@dbs;

=item Only binds and defines for data going into remote persistent LOBs are supported.

so that parameter passing in PL/SQL where CHAR data is bound or defined for remote LOBs is not allowed .

These statements all produce errors:

  SELECT foo() FROM table1@dbs2;

  SELECT foo()@dbs INTO char_val FROM DUAL;

  SELECT XMLType().getclobval FROM table1@dbs2;

=item If the remote object is a view such as

  CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT foo() FROM ...

the following would not work:

  SELECT * FROM v@dbs2;

=item Limited PL/SQL parameter passing

PL/SQL parameter passing is not allowed where the actual argument is a LOB type
and the remote argument is one of VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2, CHAR, NCHAR, or RAW.

=item RETURNING INTO does not support implicit conversions between CHAR and CLOB.

so the following returns an error:

  SELECT t1.lobcol as test, a2.lobcol FROM t1, t2.lobcol@dbs2 a2 RETURNING test

=head2 Locator Data Interface

=head3 Simple Usage

When fetching LOBs with this interface a 'LOB Locator' is created then used to get the lob with the LongReadLen and LongTruncOk attributes.
The value for 'LongReadLen' is dependent on the version and settings of the Oracle DB you are using. In theory it ranges from 8GBs
in 9iR1 up to 128 terabytes with 11g but you will also be limited by the physical memory of your PERL instance.

When inserting or updating LOBs some I<major> magic has to be performed
behind the scenes to make it transparent.  Basically the driver has to
insert a 'LOB Locator' and then refetch the newly inserted LOB
Locator before being able to write the data into it.  However, it works
well most of the time, and I've made it as fast as possible, just one
extra server-round-trip per insert or update after the first.  For the
time being, only single-row LOB updates are supported.

To insert or update a large LOB using a placeholder, DBD::Oracle has to
know in advance that it is a LOB type. So you need to say:

  $sth->bind_param($field_num, $lob_value, { ora_type => ORA_CLOB });

The ORA_CLOB and ORA_BLOB constants can be imported using

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

or use the corresponding integer values (112 and 113).

One further wrinkle: for inserts and updates of LOBs, DBD::Oracle has
to be able to tell which parameters relate to which table fields.
In all cases where it can possibly work it out for itself, it does,
however, if there are multiple LOB fields of the same type in the table
then you need to tell it which field each LOB param relates to:

  $sth->bind_param($idx, $value, { ora_type=>ORA_CLOB, ora_field=>'foo' });

There are some limitations inherent in the way DBD::Oracle makes typical
LOB operations simple by hiding the LOB Locator processing:

 - Can't read/write LOBs in chunks (except via DBMS_LOB.WRITEAPPEND in PL/SQL)
 - To INSERT a LOB, you need UPDATE privilege.

The alternative is to disable the automatic LOB Locator processing.
If L</ora_auto_lob> is 0 in prepare(), you can fetch the LOB Locators and
do all the work yourself using the ora_lob_*() methods.
See the L</Data Interface for LOB Locators> section below.

=head3 LOB support in PL/SQL

LOB Locators can be passed to PL/SQL calls by binding them to placeholders
with the proper C<ora_type>.  If L</ora_auto_lob> is true, output LOB
parameters will be automatically returned as strings.

If the Oracle driver has support for temporary LOBs (Oracle 9i and higher),
strings can be bound to input LOB placeholders and will be automatically
converted to LOBs.

Example:
     # Build a large XML document, bind it as a CLOB,
     # extract elements through PL/SQL and return as a CLOB

     # $dbh is a connected database handle
     # output will be large

     local $dbh->{LongReadLen} = 1_000_000;

     my $in_clob = "<document>\n";
     $in_clob .= "  <value>$_</value>\n" for 1 .. 10_000;
     $in_clob .= "</document>\n";

     my $out_clob;


     my $sth = $dbh->prepare(<<PLSQL_END);
     -- extract 'value' nodes
     DECLARE
       x XMLTYPE := XMLTYPE(:in);
     BEGIN
       :out := x.extract('/document/value').getClobVal();
     END;

     PLSQL_END

     # :in param will be converted to a temp lob
     # :out parameter will be returned as a string.

     $sth->bind_param( ':in', $in_clob, { ora_type => ORA_CLOB } );
     $sth->bind_param_inout( ':out', \$out_clob, 0, { ora_type => ORA_CLOB } );
     $sth->execute;

If you ever get an

  ORA-01691 unable to extend lob segment sss.ggg by nnn in tablespace ttt

error, while attempting to insert a LOB, this means the Oracle user has insufficient space for LOB you are trying to insert.
One solution it to use "alter database datafile 'sss.ggg' resize Mnnn" to increase the available memory for LOBs.

=head2 Persistent & Locator Interface Caveats

Now that one has the option of using the Persistent or the Locator interface for LOBs the questions arises
which one to use. For starters, if you want to access LOBs over a dblink you will have to use the Persistent
interface so that choice is simple.  The question of which one to use after that is a little more tricky.
It basically boils down to a choice between LOB size and speed.

The Callback and Polling piecewise fetches are very very slow
when compared to the Simple and the Locator fetches but they can handle very large blocks of data. Given a situation where a
large LOB is to be read the Locator fetch may time out while either of the piecewise fetches may not.

With the Simple fetch you are limited by physical memory of your server but it runs a little faster than the Locator, as there are fewer round trips
to the server. So if you have small LOBs and need to save a little bandwidth this is the one to use. It you are going after large LOBs then the Locator interface is the one to use.

If you need to update more than a single row of with LOB data then the Persistent interface can do it while the Locator can't.

If you encounter a situation where you have to access the legacy LOBs (LONG, LONG RAW) and the values are to large for you system then you can use
the Callback or Polling piecewise fetches to  get all of the data.

Not all of the Persistent interface has been implemented yet, the following are not supported;

  1) Piecewise, polling and callback binds for INSERT and UPDATE operations.
  2) Piecewise array binds for SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE operations.

Most of the time you should just use the L</Locator Data Interface> as this is in one that has the best combination of speed and size.

All this being said if you are doing some critical programming I would use the L</Data Interface for LOB Locators> as this gives you very
fine grain control of your LOBs, of course the code for this will be somewhat more involved.

=head2 Data Interface for LOB Locators

The following driver-specific methods let you manipulate "LOB Locators" directly.
To select a LOB locator directly set the if the C<ora_auto_lob>
attribute to false, or alternatively they can be returned via PL/SQL procedure calls.

(If using a DBI version earlier than 1.36 they must be called via the
func() method. Note that methods called via func() don't honour
RaiseError etc, and so it's important to check $dbh->err after each call.
It's recommended that you upgrade to DBI 1.38 or later.)

Note that LOB locators are only valid while the statement handle that
created them is valid.  When all references to the original statement
handle are lost, the handle is destroyed and the locators are freed.

=over 4

=item ora_lob_read

  $data = $dbh->ora_lob_read($lob_locator, $offset, $length);

Read a portion of the LOB. $offset starts at 1.
Uses the Oracle OCILobRead function.

NOTE: DBD::Oracle post 1.46 will return undef for any read lob if the
length specified in the ora_lob_read is 0. See RT 55028. This avoids
the potential problem with empty lobs (created with empty_clob) which
return a length of 0 from ora_lob_length and prior to 1.46 a call to
ora_lob_read with a 0 length would segfault.

=item ora_lob_write

  $rc = $dbh->ora_lob_write($lob_locator, $offset, $data);

Write/overwrite a portion of the LOB. $offset starts at 1.
Uses the Oracle OCILobWrite function.

=item ora_lob_append

  $rc = $dbh->ora_lob_append($lob_locator, $data);

Append $data to the LOB.  Uses the Oracle OCILobWriteAppend function.

=item ora_lob_trim

  $rc = $dbh->ora_lob_trim($lob_locator, $length);

Trims the length of the LOB to $length.
Uses the Oracle OCILobTrim function.

=item ora_lob_length

  $length = $dbh->ora_lob_length($lob_locator);

Returns the length of the LOB.
Uses the Oracle OCILobGetLength function.

=item ora_lob_is_init

  $is_init = $dbh->ora_lob_is_init($lob_locator);

Returns true(1) if the Lob Locator is initialized false(0) if it is not, or 'undef'
if there is an error.
Uses the Oracle OCILobLocatorIsInit function.

=item ora_lob_chunk_size

  $chunk_size = $dbh->ora_lob_chunk_size($lob_locator);

Returns the chunk size of the LOB.
Uses the Oracle OCILobGetChunkSize function.

For optimal performance, Oracle recommends reading from and
writing to a LOB in batches using a multiple of the LOB chunk size.
In Oracle 10g and before, when all defaults are in place, this
chunk size defaults to 8k (8192).

=head3 LOB Locator Method Examples

I<Note:> Make sure you first read the note in the section above about
multi-byte character set issues with these methods.

The following examples demonstrate the usage of LOB Locators
to read, write, and append data, and to query the size of
large data.

The following examples assume a table containing two large
object columns, one binary and one character, with a primary
key column, defined as follows:

   CREATE TABLE lob_example (
      lob_id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      bindata     BLOB,
      chardata    CLOB
   )

It also assumes a sequence for use in generating unique
lob_id field values, defined as follows:

   CREATE SEQUENCE lob_example_seq

=head3 Example: Inserting a new row with large data

Unless enough memory is available to store and bind the
entire LOB data for insert all at once, the LOB columns must
be written interactively, piece by piece.  In the case of a new row,
this is performed by first inserting a row, with empty values in
the LOB columns, then modifying the row by writing the large data
interactively to the LOB columns using their LOB locators as handles.

The insert statement must create token values in the LOB
columns.  Here, we use the empty string for both the binary
and character large object columns 'bindata' and 'chardata'.

After the INSERT statement, a SELECT statement is used to
acquire LOB locators to the 'bindata' and 'chardata' fields
