 .
      i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
         who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect

         rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
 .
      k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
         without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
         fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a

         medium.
 .
   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
      or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations
      or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
      protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
      exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
         Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
         Collections;
 .
      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
         including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
         clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
         the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
         original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
         could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
         Collections; and,
 .
      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
      e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
            the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
            of the rights granted under this License;
 .
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
            the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive
            right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License; and,
 .
       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
            royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
            a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
            schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License.
 .
      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
      known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
      modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
      media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
      granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
      subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
         this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
         Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
         Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
         the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
         recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
         under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
         must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
         disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
         Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
         may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
         restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
         rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
         Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
         this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
         made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
         upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
         remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
         requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
         You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
         credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
         terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
         the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
         jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
         contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
         Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
         License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
         mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
         you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
         mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
         comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
         following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
         the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute
         or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
         Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
         ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
         granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;
         (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable
         License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work
         as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)
         when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
         impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
         restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
         exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
         Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
         incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
         apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
         Applicable License.
 .
      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
         Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
         Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
         provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
         name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
         and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
         parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
         attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
         terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
         parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
         reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
         associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
         copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
         consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
         identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
         translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
         original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
         4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
         that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
         will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
         or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
         least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
         For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
         Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
         by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
         explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
         endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
         as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
         express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
         Attribution Parties.
 .
      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
         otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
         Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
         or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
         derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
         the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
         jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
         in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
         deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
         action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
         Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
         fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
         to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
         (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
      UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
      OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
      KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT
      OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER
      OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
      IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
      OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   7. Termination
 .
      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
         Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
         from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
         terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
         compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
         survive any termination of this License.
 .
      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
         perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
         Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
         Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
         any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
         withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
         required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
         License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
         stated above.
 .
   8. Miscellaneous
 .
      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
         the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
         terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
         offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
         and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
         applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
         the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
         by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
         the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
         enforceable.
 .
      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
         breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
         and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
         respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
         agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
         here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
         appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
         without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
         License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
         for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
         September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
         Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
         the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
         rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
         which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
         corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
         provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
         rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
         not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
         included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the

##############################################################################

Known bugs:

* The overflow/underflow exceptions may be badly handled in some functions;
  specially when the intermediary internal results have exponent which
  exceeds the hardware limit (2^30 for a 32 bits CPU, and 2^62 for a 64 bits
  CPU) or the exact result is close to an overflow/underflow threshold.

* Under Linux/x86 with the traditional FPU, some functions do not work
  if the FPU rounding precision has been changed to single (this is a
  bad practice and should be useless, but one never knows what other
  software will do).

* Some functions do not use MPFR_SAVE_EXPO_* macros, thus do not behave
  correctly in a reduced exponent range.

* Function hypot gives incorrect result when on the one hand the difference
  between parameters' exponents is near 2*MPFR_EMAX_MAX and on the other hand
  the output precision or the precision of the parameter with greatest
  absolute value is greater than 2*MPFR_EMAX_MAX-4.

Potential bugs:

* Possible incorrect results due to internal underflow, which can lead to
  a huge loss of accuracy while the error analysis doesn't take that into
  account. If the underflow occurs at the last function call (just before
  the MPFR_CAN_ROUND), the result should be correct (or MPFR gets into an
  infinite loop). TODO: check the code and the error analysis.

* Possible bugs with huge precisions (> 2^30) and a 32-bit ABI, in particular
  undetected integer overflows. TODO: use the MPFR_ADD_PREC macro.

* Possible bugs if the chosen exponent range does not allow to represent
  the range [1/16, 16].

* Possible infinite loop in some functions for particular cases: when
  the exact result is an exactly representable number or the middle of
  consecutive two such numbers. However, for non-algebraic functions, it is
  believed that no such case exists, except the well-known cases like cos(0)=1,
  exp(0)=1, and so on, and the x^y function when y is an integer or y=1/2^k.

* The mpfr_set_ld function may be quite slow if the long double type has an
  exponent of more than 15 bits.

* mpfr_set_d may give wrong results on some non-IEEE architectures.

* Error analysis for some functions may be incorrect (out-of-date due
  to modifications in the code?).

* Possible use of non-portable feature (pre-C99) of the integer division
  with negative result.
