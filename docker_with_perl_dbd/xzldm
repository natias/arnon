=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 New Diagnostics

=head3 New Errors

=over 4

=item *

L<Can't "%s" out of a "defer" block|perldiag/"Can't "%s" out of a "defer" block">

(F) An attempt was made to jump out of the scope of a defer block by using
a control-flow statement such as C<return>, C<goto> or a loop control. This is
not permitted.

=item *

L<Can't modify %s in %s|perldiag/"Can't modify %s in %s"> (for scalar
assignment to C<undef>)

Attempting to perform a scalar assignment to C<undef>, for example via
C<undef = $foo;>, previously triggered a fatal runtime error with the
message "L<Modification of a read-only value attempted|perldiag/"Modification of a read-only value attempted">."
It is more helpful to detect such attempted assignments prior to runtime, so
they are now compile time errors, resulting in the message "Can't modify undef
operator in scalar assignment".

=item *

L<panic: newFORLOOP, %s|perldiag/"panic: newFORLOOP, %s">

The parser failed an internal consistency check while trying to parse
a C<foreach> loop.

=back

=head3 New Warnings

=over 4

=item *

L<Built-in function '%s' is experimental|perldiag/"Built-in function '%s' is experimental">

A call is being made to a function in the C<builtin::> namespace, which is
currently experimental.

=item *

L<defer is experimental|perldiag/"defer is experimental">

The C<defer> block modifier is experimental. If you want to use the feature,
disable the warning with C<no warnings 'experimental::defer'>, but know that in
doing so you are taking the risk that your code may break in a future Perl
version.

=item *

L<Downgrading a use VERSION declaration to below v5.11 is deprecated|perldiag/"Downgrading a use VERSION declaration to below v5.11 is deprecated">

This warning is emitted on a C<use VERSION> statement that
requests a version below v5.11 (when the effects of C<use strict> would be
disabled), after a previous declaration of one having a larger number (which
would have enabled these effects)

=item *

L<for my (...) is experimental|perldiag/"for my (...) is experimental">

This warning is emitted if you use C<for> to iterate multiple values at
a time. This syntax is currently experimental and its behaviour may
change in future releases of Perl.

=item *

L<Implicit use of @_ in %s with signatured subroutine is experimental|perldiag/"Implicit use of @_ in %s with signatured subroutine is experimental">

An expression that implicitly involves the C<@_> arguments array was found in
a subroutine that uses a signature.

=item *

L<Use of @_ in %s with signatured subroutine is experimental|perldiag/"Use of @_ in %s with signatured subroutine is experimental">

An expression involving the C<@_> arguments array was found in a subroutine that uses a signature.

=item *

L<Wide character in $0|perldiag/"Wide character in %s">

Attempts to put wide characters into the program name (C<$0>) now provoke this
warning.

=back

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=over 4

=item *

L<'E<sol>' does not take a repeat count in %s|perldiag/"'/' does not take a repeat count in %s">

This warning used to not include the C<in %s>.

=item *

L<Subroutine %s redefined|perldiag/"Subroutine %s redefined">

Localized subroutine redefinitions no longer trigger this warning.

=item *

L<unexpected constant lvalue entersub entry via typeE<sol>targ %d:%d"|perldiag/"panic: unexpected constant lvalue entersub entry via type/targ %d:%d"> now has a panic prefix

This makes it consistent with other checks of internal consistency when
compiling a subroutine.

=item *

L<Useless use of sort in scalar context|perldiag/"Useless use of %s in scalar
context"> is now in the new C<scalar> category.

When C<sort> is used in scalar context, it provokes a warning that doing this
is not useful. This warning used to be in the C<void> category. A new category
for warnings about scalar context has now been added, called C<scalar>.

=item *

Removed a number of diagnostics

Many diagnostics that have been removed from the perl core across many years
have now I<also> been removed from the documentation.

=back

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

The Perl C source code now uses some C99 features, which we have verified are
supported by all compilers we target. This means that Perl's headers now
contain some code that is legal in C99 but not C89.

This may cause problems for some XS modules that unconditionally add
C<-Werror=declaration-after-statement> to their C compiler flags if compiling
with gcc or clang. Earlier versions of Perl support long obsolete compilers
that are strict in rejecting certain C99 features, particularly mixed
declarations and code, and hence it makes sense for XS module authors to audit
that their code does not violate this. However, doing this is now only
possible on these earlier versions of Perl, hence these modules need to be
changed to only add this flag for C<< $] < 5.035005 >>.

=item *

The makedepend step is now run in parallel by using make

When using MAKEFLAGS=-j8, this significantly reduces the time required for:

    sh ./makedepend MAKE=make cflags

=item *

F<Configure> now tests whether C<< #include <xlocale.h> >> is required
to use the POSIX 1003 thread-safe locale functions or some related
extensions.  This prevents problems where a non-public F<xlocale.h> is
removed in a library update, or F<xlocale.h> isn't intended for public
use. (github L<#18936|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18936>)

=back

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Windows

=over 4

=item *

Support for old MSVC++ (pre-VC12) has been removed

These did not support C99 and hence can no longer be used to compile perl.

=item *

Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
(containing Visual C++ 14.3) has been added.

=item *

The :win32 IO layer has been removed. This experimental replacement for the
:unix layer never reached maturity in its nearly two decades of existence.

=back

=head2 VMS

=over 4

=item C<keys %ENV> on VMS returns consistent results

On VMS entries in the C<%ENV> hash are loaded from the OS environment on
first access, hence the first iteration of C<%ENV> requires the entire
environment to be scanned to find all possible keys. This initialisation had
always been done correctly for full iteration, but previously was not
happening for C<%ENV> in scalar context, meaning that C<scalar %ENV> would
return 0 if called before any other C<%ENV> access, or would only return the
count of keys accessed if there had been no iteration.

These bugs are now fixed - C<%ENV> and C<keys %ENV> in scalar context now
return the correct result - the count of all keys in the environment.

=back

=head2 Discontinued Platforms

=over 4

=item AT&T UWIN

UWIN is a UNIX compatibility layer for Windows.  It was last released
in 2012 and has been superseded by Cygwin these days.

=item DOS/DJGPP

DJGPP is a port of the GNU toolchain to 32-bit x86 systems running
DOS.  The last known attempt to build Perl on it was on 5.20, which
only got as far as building miniperl.

=item NetWare

Support code for Novell NetWare has been removed.  NetWare was a
server operating system by Novell.  The port was last updated in July
2002, and the platform itself in May 2009.

Unrelated changes accidentally broke the build for the NetWare port in
September 2009, and in 12 years no-one has reported this.

=back

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item z/OS

This update enables us to build EBCDIC static/dynamic and 31-bit/64-bit
addressing mode Perl. The number of tests that pass is consistent with the
baseline before these updates.

These changes also provide the base support to be able to provide ASCII
static/dynamic and 31-bit/64-bit addressing mode Perl.

The z/OS (previously called OS/390) README was updated to describe ASCII and
EBCDIC builds.

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Since the removal of PERL_OBJECT in Perl 5.8, PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and
MULTIPLICITY have been synonymous and they were being used interchangeably.
To simplify the code, all instances of PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT have been
replaced with MULTIPLICITY.

PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT will remain defined for compatibility with XS modules.

=item *

The API constant formerly named C<G_ARRAY>, indicating list context, has now
been renamed to a more accurate C<G_LIST>.  A compatibilty macro C<G_ARRAY> has
been added to allow existing code to work unaffected.  New code should be
written using the new constant instead.  This is supported by C<Devel::PPPort>
version 3.63.

=item *

Macros have been added to F<perl.h> to facilitate version comparisons:
C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_GE>, C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_GT>, C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_LE> and
C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_LT>.

Inline functions have been added to F<embed.h> to determine the position of
the least significant 1 bit in a word: C<lsbit_pos32> and C<lsbit_pos64>.

=item *

C<Perl_ptr_table_clear> has been deleted. This has been marked as deprecated
since v5.14.0 (released in 2011), and is not used by any code on CPAN.

Added new boolean macros and functions. See L</Stable boolean tracking> for

C<xs_handshake()>'s two failure modes now provide distinct messages.

=item *

Memory for hash iterator state (C<struct xpvhv_aux>) is now allocated as part
of the hash body, instead of as part of the block of memory allocated for the
main hash array.

=item *

A new phase_name() interface provides access to the name for each interpreter
phase (i.e., PL_phase value).

=item *

The C<pack> behavior of C<U> has changed for EBCDIC.

=item *

New equality-test functions C<sv_numeq> and C<sv_streq> have been added, along
with C<..._flags>-suffixed variants.  These expose a simple and consistent API
to perform numerical or string comparison which is aware of operator
overloading.

=item *

Reading the string form of an integer value no longer sets the flag C<SVf_POK>.
The string form is still cached internally, and still re-read directly by the
macros C<SvPV(sv)> I<etc> (inline, without calling a C function). XS code that
already calls the APIs to get values will not be affected by this change. XS
code that accesses flags directly instead of using API calls to express its
intent I<might> break, but such code likely is already buggy if passed some
other values, such as floating point values or objects with string overloading.

This small change permits code (such as JSON serializers) to reliably determine
between

=over 4

=item *

a value that was initially B<written> as an integer, but then B<read> as a string

    my $answer = 42;
    print "The answer is $answer\n";

=item *

that same value that was initially B<written> as a string, but then B<read> as an integer

    my $answer = "42";
    print "That doesn't look right\n"
        unless $answer == 6 * 9;

=back

For the first case (originally written as an integer), we now have:

    use Devel::Peek;
    my $answer = 42;
    Dump ($answer);
    my $void = "$answer";
    print STDERR "\n";
    Dump($answer)


    SV = IV(0x562538925778) at 0x562538925788
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
      IV = 42

    SV = PVIV(0x5625389263c0) at 0x562538925788
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK,pPOK)
      IV = 42
      PV = 0x562538919b50 "42"\0
      CUR = 2
      LEN = 10

For the second (originally written as a string), we now have:

    use Devel::Peek;
    my $answer = "42";
    Dump ($answer);
    my $void = $answer == 6 * 9;
    print STDERR "\n";
    Dump($answer)'


    SV = PV(0x5586ffe9bfb0) at 0x5586ffec0788
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (POK,IsCOW,pPOK)
      PV = 0x5586ffee7fd0 "42"\0
      CUR = 2
      LEN = 10
      COW_REFCNT = 1

    SV = PVIV(0x5586ffec13c0) at 0x5586ffec0788
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,POK,IsCOW,pIOK,pPOK)
      IV = 42
      PV = 0x5586ffee7fd0 "42"\0
      CUR = 2
      LEN = 10
      COW_REFCNT = 1

(One can't rely on the presence or absence of the flag C<SVf_IsCOW> to
determine the history of operations on a scalar.)

Previously both cases would be indistinguishable, with all 4 flags set:

    SV = PVIV(0x55d4d62edaf0) at 0x55d4d62f0930
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (IOK,POK,pIOK,pPOK)
      IV = 42
      PV = 0x55d4d62e1740 "42"\0
      CUR = 2
      LEN = 10

(and possibly C<SVf_IsCOW>, but not always)

This now means that if XS code I<really> needs to determine which form a value
was first written as, it should implement logic roughly

    if (flags & SVf_IOK|SVf_NOK) && !(flags & SVf_POK)
        serialize as number
    else if (flags & SVf_POK)
        serialize as string
    else
        the existing guesswork ...

Note that this doesn't cover "dualvars" - scalars that report different
values when asked for their string form or number form (such as C<$!>).
Most serialization formats cannot represent such duplicity.

I<The existing guesswork> remains because as well as dualvars, values might
be C<undef>, references, overloaded references, typeglobs and other things that
Perl itself can represent but do not map one-to-one into external formats, so
need some amount of approximation or encapsulation.

=item *

C<sv_dump> (and L<Devel::Peek>’s C<Dump> function) now escapes high-bit
octets in the PV as hex rather than octal. Since most folks understand hex
more readily than octal, this should make these dumps a bit more legible.
This does B<not> affect any other diagnostic interfaces like C<pv_display>.

=item *

utime() now correctly sets errno/C<$!> when called on a closed handle.

=item *

The flags on the OPTVAL parameter to setsockopt() were previously
checked before magic was called, possibly treating a numeric value as
a packed buffer or vice versa.  It also ignored the UTF-8 flag,
potentially treating the internal representation of an upgraded SV as
the bytes to supply to the setsockopt() system call.  (github L<#18660|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18660>)

Only set IOKp, not IOK on $) and $(.
This was issue L<#18955|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18955>: This will prevent serializers from serializing these
variables as numbers (which loses the additional groups).
This restores behaviour from 5.16

Use of the C<mktables> debugging facility would cause perl to croak since
v5.31.10; this problem has now been fixed.

C<makedepend> logic is now compatible with BSD make (fixes
L<GH #19046|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19046>).

=item *

Calling C<untie> on a tied hash that is partway through iteration now frees the
iteration state immediately.

Iterating a tied hash causes perl to store a copy of the current hash key to
track the iteration state, with this stored copy passed as the second parameter
to C<NEXTKEY>. This internal state is freed immediately when tie hash iteration
completes, or if the hash is destroyed, but due to an implementation oversight,
it was not freed if the hash was untied. In that case, the internal copy of the
key would persist until the earliest of

C<tie> was called again on the same hash

=item 2

The (now untied) hash was iterated (ie passed to any of C<keys>, C<values> or
C<each>)

=item 3

The hash was destroyed.

=back

This inconsistency is now fixed - the internal state is now freed immediately by
C<untie>.

As the precise timing of this behaviour can be observed with pure Perl code
(the timing of C<DESTROY> on objects returned from C<FIRSTKEY> and C<NEXTKEY>)
it's just possible that some code is sensitive to it.

=item *

C<Configure> probed for the return type of malloc() and free() by testing
whether declarations for those functions produced a function type mismatch with
the implementation.  On Solaris, with a C++ compiler, this check always failed,
since Solaris instead imports malloc() and free() from C<std::> with C<using>
for C++ builds.  Since the return types of malloc() and free() are well defined
by the C standard, skip probing for them.  C<Configure> command-line arguments
and hints can still override these type in the unlikely case that is needed.

=head1 NAME

perl5362delta - what is new for perl v5.36.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.36.1 release and the 5.36.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.36.0, first read
L<perl5361delta>, which describes differences between 5.36.0 and 5.36.1.

=head1 Security

This release fixes the following security issues. 

=head2 CVE-2023-47038 - Write past buffer end via illegal user-defined Unicode property

This vulnerability was reported directly to the Perl security team by
Nathan Mills C<the.true.nathan.mills@gmail.com>.

A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through
5.38.0 can cause a one-byte attacker controlled buffer overflow in a
heap allocated buffer.

=head2 CVE-2023-47039 - Perl for Windows binary hijacking vulnerability

This vulnerability was reported to the Intel Product Security Incident
Response Team (PSIRT) by GitHub user ycdxsb
L<https://github.com/ycdxsb/WindowsPrivilegeEscalation>. PSIRT then
reported it to the Perl security team.

Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to
find the shell (C<cmd.exe>). When running an executable which uses
Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute C<cmd.exe>
within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues,
Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory.

An attacker with limited privileges can exploit this behavior by
placing C<cmd.exe> in locations with weak permissions, such as
C<C:\ProgramData>. By doing so, when an administrator attempts to use
this executable from these compromised locations, arbitrary code can
be executed.
