    failures and delays when executing gofer requests. Designed to help
    test automatic retry on failures and timeout handling.
  Added lots more docs to all the DBD::Gofer and DBI::Gofer classes.

      have not been overridden by the remote driver.
    Most significant aspects of gofer behaviour are controlled by policy mechanism.
    Added policy-controlled caching of results for some methods, such as schema metadata.
    The connect_cached and prepare_cached methods cache on client and server.

  Changed docs to clarify pre-method clearing of err values.

  Added ability for DBI::ProfileData to edit profile path on loading.

  Fixed DBD::File problem with encoding pragma thanks to Erik Rijkers.

  Changed error handling so undef errstr doesn't cause warning.

    Jonathan Leffler. This may generate warnings for perl 5.6.
  Changed DBI::PurePerl to set autoflush on trace filehandle.

=head2 Changes in DBI 1.42 (svn rev 222) - 12 Mar 2004

  Fixed $sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS} of non-executed statement handle
    to be undef as per the docs (it was 0).
  Fixed t/41prof_dump.t to work with perl5.9.1.
  Fixed DBD_ATTRIB_DELETE macro thanks to Marco Paskamp.
  Fixed DBI::PurePerl looks_like_number() and $DBI::rows.
  Fixed ref($h)->can("foo") to not croak.

  Changed attributes (NAME, TYPE etc) of non-executed statement
    handle to be undef instead of triggering an error.
  Changed ShowErrorStatement to apply to more $dbh methods.
  Changed DBI_TRACE env var so just does this at load time:
    DBI->trace(split '=', $ENV{DBI_TRACE}, 2);
  Improved "invalid number of parameters" error message.
  Added DBI::common as base class for DBI::db, DBD::st etc.
  Moved methods common to all handles into DBI::common.

  Major tracing enhancement:

  Added $h->parse_trace_flags("foo|SQL|7") to map a group of
    trace flags into the corresponding trace flag bits.
  Added automatic calling of parse_trace_flags() if
    setting the trace level to a non-numeric value:
    $h->{TraceLevel}="foo|SQL|7"; $h->trace("foo|SQL|7");
    DBI->connect("dbi:Driver(TraceLevel=SQL|foo):...", ...);
    Currently no trace flags have been defined.
  Added to, and reworked, the trace documentation.
  Added dbivport.h for driver authors to use.

  Major driver additions that Jeff Zucker and I have been working on:

  Added DBI::SQL::Nano a 'smaller than micro' SQL parser
    with an SQL::Statement compatible API. If SQL::Statement
    is installed then DBI::SQL::Nano becomes an empty subclass
    of SQL::Statement, unless the DBI_SQL_NANO env var is true.
  Added DBD::File, modified to use DBI::SQL::Nano.
  Added DBD::DBM, an SQL interface to DBM files using DBD::File.

  Documentation changes:

  Corrected typos in docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Corrected execute_for_fetch example thanks to Dean Arnold.

=head2 Changes in DBI 1.41 (svn rev 130) - 22 Feb 2004

  Fixed execute_for_array() so tuple_status parameter is optional
    as per docs, thanks to Ed Avis.
  Fixed execute_for_array() docs to say that it returns undef if
    any of the execute() calls fail.
  Fixed take_imp_data() test on m68k reported by Christian Hammers.
  Fixed write_typeinfo_pm inconsistencies in DBI::DBD::Metadata
    thanks to Andy Hassall.
  Fixed $h->{TraceLevel} to not return DBI->trace trace level
    which it used to if DBI->trace trace level was higher.

  Changed set_err() to append to errstr, with a leading "\n" if it's
    not empty, so that multiple error/warning messages are recorded.
  Changed trace to limit elements dumped when an array reference is
    returned from a method to the max(40, $DBI::neat_maxlen/10)
    so that fetchall_arrayref(), for example, doesn't flood the trace.
  Changed trace level to be a four bit integer (levels 0 thru 15)
    and a set of topic flags (no topics have been assigned yet).
  Changed column_info() to check argument count.
  Extended bind_param() TYPE attribute specification to imply
    standard formating of value, eg SQL_DATE implies 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

  Added way for drivers to indicate 'success with info' or 'warning'
    by setting err to "0" for warning and "" for information.
    Both values are false and so don't trigger RaiseError etc.
    Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for the original idea.
  Added $h->{HandleSetErr} = sub { ... } to be called at the
    point that an error, warn, or info state is recorded.
    The code can alter the err, errstr, and state values
    (e.g., to promote an error to a warning, or the reverse).
  Added $h->{PrintWarn} attribute to enable printing of warnings
    recorded by the driver. Defaults to same value as $^W (perl -w).
  Added $h->{ErrCount} attribute, incremented whenever an error is
    recorded by the driver via set_err().
  Added $h->{Executed} attribute, set if do()/execute() called.

  Added ref count of inner handle to "DESTROY ignored for outer" msg.
  Added Win32 build config checks to DBI::DBD thanks to Andy Hassall.

  Added TYPE attribute to bind_col and specified the expected
    driver behaviour.

  Major update to signal handling docs thanks to Lincoln Baxter.
  Corrected dbiproxy usage doc thanks to Christian Hammers.
  Corrected type_info_all index hash docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Corrected type_info COLUMN_SIZE to chars not bytes thanks to Dean Arnold.
  Corrected get_info() docs to include details of DBI::Const::GetInfoType.
  Clarified that $sth->{PRECISION} is OCTET_LENGTH for char types.

=head2 Changes in DBI 1.40 - 07 Jan 2004

  Fixed handling of CachedKids when DESTROYing threaded handles.

  Fixed STORE to not clear error during nested DBI call, again/better,
    thanks to Tony Bowden for the report and helpful test case.
  Fixed DBI dispatch to not try to use AUTOLOAD for driver methods unless
    the method has been declared (as methods should be when using AUTOLOAD).
    This fixes a problem when the Attribute::Handlers module is loaded.
  Fixed cwd check code to use $Config{path_sep} thanks to Steve Hay.
  Fixed unqualified croak() calls thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Fixed DBD::ExampleP TYPE and PRECISION attributes thanks to Tom Lowery.
  Fixed tracing of methods that only get traced at high trace levels.

  The level 1 trace no longer includes nested method calls so it generally
    just shows the methods the application explicitly calls.
  Added line to trace log (level>=4) when err/errstr is cleared.
  Updated docs for InactiveDestroy and point out where and when the
    trace includes the process id.
  Update DBI::DBD docs thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Removed docs saying that the DBI->data_sources method could be
    passed a $dbh. The $dbh->data_sources method should be used instead.
  Added link to 'DBI recipes' thanks to Giuseppe Maxia:
    http://gmax.oltrelinux.com/dbirecipes.html (note that this
    is not an endorsement that the recipies are 'optimal')

  Note: There is a bug in perl 5.8.2 when configured with threads
  and debugging enabled (bug #24463) which causes a DBI test to fail.

=head2 Changes in DBI 1.38 - 21 Aug 2003

  NOTE: The DBI now requires perl version 5.6.0 or later.

  Fixed 64bit warnings thanks to Marian Jancar.
  Fixed DBD::Proxy::db::DESTROY to not alter $@ thanks to Keith Chapman.
  Fixed Makefile.PL status from WriteMakefile() thanks to Leon Brocard.

  Changed "Can't set ...->{Foo}: unrecognised attribute" from an error to a
    warning when running with DBI::ProxyServer to simplify upgrades.
  Changed execute_array() to no longer require ArrayTupleStatus attribute.
  Changed DBI->available_drivers to not hide DBD::Sponge.
  Updated/moved placeholder docs to a better place thanks to Johan Vromans.
  Changed dbd_db_do4 api in Driver.xst to match dbd_st_execute (return int,
    not bool), relevant only to driver authors.
  Changed neat(), and thus trace(), so strings marked as utf8 are presented
    in double quotes instead of single quotes and are not sanitized.

  Added $dbh->data_sources method.
  Added $dbh->last_insert_id method.
  Added $sth->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status) method.
  Added DBI->installed_versions thanks to Jeff Zucker.

    helps threaded server mode, thanks to Bob Showalter.
  Changed execute_array() return value from row count to executed
    tuple count, and now the ArrayTupleStatus attribute is mandatory.
    NOTE: That is an API definition change that may affect your code.
  Changed CompatMode attribute to also disable attribute 'quick FETCH'.
  Changed attribute FETCH to be slightly faster thanks to Stas Bekman.

  Added workaround for perl bug #17575 tied hash nested FETCH
    thanks to Silvio Wanka.
  Added Username and Password attributes to connect(..., \%attr) and so
    also embedded in DSN like "dbi:Driver(Username=user,Password=pass):..."
    Username and Password can't contain ")", ",", or "=" characters.
    The predence is DSN first, then \%attr, then $user & $pass parameters,
    and finally the DBI_USER & DBI_PASS environment variables.
    The Username attribute is stored in the $dbh but the Password is not.
  Added ProxyServer HOWTO configure restrictions docs thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
  Added MaxRows attribute to selectcol_arrayref prompted by Wojciech Pietron.
  Added dump_handle as a method not just a DBI:: utility function.
  Added on-demand by-row data feed into execute_array() using code ref,
    or statement handle. For example, to insert from a select:
    $insert_sth->execute_array( { ArrayTupleFetch => $select_sth, ... } )
  Added warning to trace log when $h->{foo}=... is ignored due to
    invalid prefix (e.g., not 'private_').

  Fixed disconnect_all() to not be required by drivers.

  Added $okay = $h->can($method_name) to check if a method exists.
  Added DBD::*::*->install_method($method_name, \%attr) so driver private
    methods can be 'installed' into the DBI dispatcher and no longer
    need to be called using $h->func(..., $method_name).

  Enhanced $dbh->clone() and documentation.
  Enhanced docs to note that dbi_time(), and thus profiling, is limited
    to only millisecond (seconds/1000) resolution on Windows.
  Removed old DBI::Shell from distribution and added Tom Lowery's improved
    version to the Bundle::DBI file.
  Updated minimum version numbers for modules in Bundle::DBI.
