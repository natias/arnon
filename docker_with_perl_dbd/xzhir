introduce Y2K problems, but those are not really part of Vim itself.

*love* *peace* *friendship* *gross-national-happiness*


In this documentation there are several references to other versions of Vi:
							*Vi* *vi*
Vi	"the original".  Without further remarks this is the version
	of Vi that appeared in Sun OS 4.x.  ":version" returns
	"Version 3.7, 6/7/85".  Sometimes other versions are referred
	to.  Only runs under Unix.  Source code is now available under a
	BSD-style license.  More information on Vi can be found through:
		http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/
							*Posix*
Posix	From the IEEE standard 1003.2, Part 2: Shell and utilities.
	Generally known as "Posix".  This is a textual description of
	how Vi is supposed to work.
	See |posix-compliance|.
							*Nvi*
Nvi	The "New" Vi.  The version of Vi that comes with BSD 4.4 and FreeBSD.
	Very good compatibility with the original Vi, with a few extensions.
	The version used is 1.79.  ":version" returns "Version 1.79
	(10/23/96)".  There has been no release the last few years, although
	there is a development version 1.81.
	Source code is freely available.
							*Elvis*
Elvis	Another Vi clone, made by Steve Kirkendall.  Very compact but isn't
	as flexible as Vim.  Development has stalled, Elvis has left the
	building!  Source code is freely available.
							*Neovim*
Neovim	A Vim clone.  Forked the Vim source in 2014 and went a different way.
	Very much bound to github and has many more dependencies, making
	development more complex and limiting portability.  Code has been
	refactored, resulting in patches not being exchangeable with Vim.
	Supports a remote GUI and integration with scripting languages.

==============================================================================
4. Notation						*notation*

When syntax highlighting is used to read this, text that is not typed
literally is often highlighted with the Special group.  These are items in [],
{} and <>, and CTRL-X.

Note that Vim uses all possible characters in commands.  Sometimes the [], {}
and <> are part of what you type, the context should make this clear.


[]		Characters in square brackets are optional.

						    *count* *[count]*
[count]		An optional number that may precede the command to multiply
		or iterate the command.  If no number is given, a count of one
		is used, unless otherwise noted.  Note that in this manual the
		[count] is not mentioned in the description of the command,
		but only in the explanation.  This was done to make the
		commands easier to look up.  If the 'showcmd' option is on,
		the (partially) entered count is shown at the bottom of the
		window.  You can use <Del> to erase the last digit (|N<Del>|).

							*[quotex]*
["x]		An optional register designation where text can be stored.
		See |registers|.  The x is a single character between 'a' and
		'z' or 'A' and 'Z' or '"', and in some cases (with the put
		command) between '0' and '9', '%', '#', or others.  The
		uppercase and lowercase letter designate the same register,
		but the lowercase letter is used to overwrite the previous
		register contents, while the uppercase letter is used to
		append to the previous register contents.  Without the ""x" or
		with """" the stored text is put into the unnamed register.

							*{}*
{}		Curly braces denote parts of the command which must appear,
		but which can take a number of different values.  The
		differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces
		(this will be clear from the context).

							*{char1-char2}*
{char1-char2}	A single character from the range char1 to char2.  For
		example: {a-z} is a lowercase letter.  Multiple ranges may be
		concatenated.  For example, {a-zA-Z0-9} is any alphanumeric
		character.

						*{motion}* *movement*
{motion}	A command that moves the cursor.  These are explained in
		|motion.txt|.  Examples:
			w		to start of next word
			b		to begin of current word
			4j		four lines down
			/The<CR>	to next occurrence of "The"
		This is used after an |operator| command to move over the text
		that is to be operated upon.
		- If the motion includes a count and the operator also has a
		  count, the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w"
		  deletes six words.
		- The motion can be backwards, e.g. "db" to delete to the
		  start of the word.
		- The motion can also be a mouse click.  The mouse is not
		  supported in every terminal though.
		- The ":omap" command can be used to map characters while an
		  operator is pending.
		- Ex commands can be used to move the cursor.  This can be
		  used to call a function that does some complicated motion.
		  The motion is always characterwise exclusive, no matter
		  what ":" command is used.  This means it's impossible to
		  include the last character of a line without the line break
		  (unless 'virtualedit' is set).
		  If the Ex command changes the text before where the operator
		  starts or jumps to another buffer the result is
		  unpredictable.  It is possible to change the text further
		  down.  Jumping to another buffer is possible if the current
		  buffer is not unloaded.

							*{Visual}*
{Visual}	A selected text area.  It is started with the "v", "V", or
		CTRL-V command, then any cursor movement command can be used
		to change the end of the selected text.
		This is used before an |operator| command to highlight the
		text that is to be operated upon.
		See |Visual-mode|.

							*<character>*
<character>	A special character from the table below, optionally with
		modifiers, or a single ASCII character with modifiers.

							*'character'*
'c'		A single ASCII character.

							*CTRL-{char}*
CTRL-{char}	{char} typed as a control character; that is, typing {char}
		while holding the CTRL key down.  The case of {char} does not
		matter; thus CTRL-A and CTRL-a are equivalent.  But on some
		terminals, using the SHIFT key will produce another code,
		don't use it then.

							*'option'*
'option'	An option, or parameter, that can be set to a value, is
		enclosed in single quotes.  See |options|.

							*quotecommandquote*
"command"	A reference to a command that you can type is enclosed in
		double quotes.
`command`	New style command, this distinguishes it from other quoted
		text and strings.

					*key-notation* *key-codes* *keycodes*
These names for keys are used in the documentation.  They can also be used
with the ":map" command (insert the key name by pressing CTRL-K and then the
key you want the name for).

<A-...>		same as <M-...>			*<A-*
<D-...>		command-key (Macintosh only)	*<D-*
<t_xx>		key with "xx" entry in termcap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The shifted cursor keys, the help key, and the undo key are only
available on a few terminals.  On the Amiga, shifted function key 10 produces
a code (CSI) that is also used by key sequences.  It will be recognized only
after typing another key.

Note: There are two codes for the delete key.  127 is the decimal ASCII value
for the delete key, which is always recognized.  Some delete keys send another
value, in which case this value is obtained from the termcap entry "kD".  Both
values have the same effect.  Also see |:fixdel|.

Note: The keypad keys are used in the same way as the corresponding "normal"
keys.  For example, <kHome> has the same effect as <Home>.  If a keypad key
sends the same raw key code as its non-keypad equivalent, it will be
recognized as the non-keypad code.  For example, when <kHome> sends the same
code as <Home>, when pressing <kHome> Vim will think <Home> was pressed.
Mapping <kHome> will not work then.

								*<>*
Examples are often given in the <> notation.  Sometimes this is just to make
clear what you need to type, but often it can be typed literally, e.g., with
the ":map" command.  The rules are:
 1.  Any printable characters are typed directly, except backslash and '<'
 2.  A backslash is represented with "\\", double backslash, or "<Bslash>".
 3.  A real '<' is represented with "\<" or "<lt>".  When there is no
     confusion possible, a '<' can be used directly.
 4.  "<key>" means the special key typed.  This is the notation explained in
     the table above.  A few examples:
	   <Esc>		Escape key
	   <C-G>		CTRL-G
	   <Up>			cursor up key
	   <C-LeftMouse>	Control- left mouse click
	   <S-F11>		Shifted function key 11
	   <M-a>		Meta- a  ('a' with bit 8 set)
	   <M-A>		Meta- A  ('A' with bit 8 set)
	   <t_kd>		"kd" termcap entry (cursor down key)
    Although you can specify <M-{char}> with {char} being a multibyte
    character, Vim may not be able to know what byte sequence that is and then
    it won't work.

If you want to use the full <> notation in Vim, you have to make sure the '<'
flag is excluded from 'cpoptions' (when 'compatible' is not set, it already is
by default). >
	:set cpo-=<
The <> notation uses <lt> to escape the special meaning of key names.  Using a
backslash also works, but only when 'cpoptions' does not include the 'B' flag.

Examples for mapping CTRL-H to the six characters "<Home>": >
	:imap <C-H> \<Home>
	:imap <C-H> <lt>Home>
The first one only works when the 'B' flag is not in 'cpoptions'.  The second
one always works.
To get a literal "<lt>" in a mapping: >
	:map <C-L> <lt>lt>

For mapping, abbreviation and menu commands you can then copy-paste the
examples and use them directly.  Or type them literally, including the '<' and
'>' characters.  This does NOT work for other commands, like ":set" and
":autocmd"!

The notation can be used in a double quoted strings, using "\<" at the start,
e.g. "\<C-Space>".  This results in a special key code.  To convert this back
to readable text use `keytrans()`.

==============================================================================
5. Modes, introduction				*vim-modes-intro* *vim-modes*

Vim has seven BASIC modes:

					*Normal* *Normal-mode* *command-mode*
Normal mode		In Normal mode you can enter all the normal editor
			commands.  If you start the editor you are in this
			mode (unless you have set the 'insertmode' option,
			see below).  This is also known as command mode.

Visual mode		This is like Normal mode, but the movement commands
			extend a highlighted area.  When a non-movement
			command is used, it is executed for the highlighted
			area.  See |Visual-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VISUAL --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Select mode		This looks most like the MS-Windows selection mode.
			Typing a printable character deletes the selection
			and starts Insert mode.  See |Select-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- SELECT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Insert mode		In Insert mode the text you type is inserted into the
			buffer.  See |Insert-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- INSERT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Command-line mode	In Command-line mode (also called Cmdline mode) you
Cmdline mode		can enter one line of text at the bottom of the
			window.  This is for the Ex commands, ":", the pattern
			search commands, "?" and "/", and the filter command,
			"!".  |Cmdline-mode|

Ex mode			Like Command-line mode, but after entering a command
			you remain in Ex mode.  Very limited editing of the
			command line.  |Ex-mode|

Terminal-Job mode	Interacting with a job in a terminal window.  Typed
			keys go to the job and the job output is displayed in
			the terminal window.  See |terminal| about how to
			switch to other modes.

There are seven ADDITIONAL modes.  These are variants of the BASIC modes:

				*Operator-pending* *Operator-pending-mode*
Operator-pending mode	This is like Normal mode, but after an operator
			command has started, and Vim is waiting for a {motion}
			to specify the text that the operator will work on.

Replace mode		Replace mode is a special case of Insert mode.  You
			can do the same things as in Insert mode, but for
			each character you enter, one character of the existing
			text is deleted.  See |Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- REPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Virtual Replace mode	Virtual Replace mode is similar to Replace mode, but
			instead of file characters you are replacing screen
			real estate.  See |Virtual-Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VREPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Normal mode	Entered when CTRL-O is typed in Insert mode (see
			|i_CTRL-O|).  This is like Normal mode, but after
			executing one command Vim returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Terminal-Normal mode	Using Normal mode in a terminal window.  Making
			changes is impossible.  Use an insert command, such as
			"a" or "i", to return to Terminal-Job mode.

Insert Visual mode	Entered when starting a Visual selection from Insert
			mode, e.g., by using CTRL-O and then "v", "V" or
			CTRL-V.  When the Visual selection ends, Vim returns
			to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) VISUAL --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Select mode	Entered when starting Select mode from Insert mode.
			E.g., by dragging the mouse or <S-Right>.
			When the Select mode ends, Vim returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) SELECT --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

==============================================================================
6. Switching from mode to mode				*mode-switching*

If for any reason you do not know which mode you are in, you can always get
back to Normal mode by typing <Esc> twice.  This doesn't work for Ex mode
though, use ":visual".
You will know you are back in Normal mode when you see the screen flash or
hear the bell after you type <Esc>.  However, when pressing <Esc> after using
CTRL-O in Insert mode you get a beep but you are still in Insert mode, type
<Esc> again.

							*i_esc*
		TO mode						    ~
		Normal	Visual	Select	Insert	  Replace   Cmd-line  Ex ~
FROM mode								 ~
Normal			v V ^V	  *4	 *1	   R gR     : / ? !   Q
Visual		 *2		  ^G	 c C	    --	      :       --
Select		 *5	^O ^G		 *6	    --	      --      --
Insert		 <Esc>	  --	  --		  <Insert>    --      --
Replace		 <Esc>	  --	  --	<Insert>	      --      --
Command-line	 *3	  --	  --	 :start	    --		      --
Ex		 :vi	  --	  --	 --	    --	      --

-- not possible

*1 Go from Normal mode to Insert mode by giving the command "i", "I", "a",
   "A", "o", "O", "c", "C", "s" or S".
*2 Go from Visual mode to Normal mode by giving a non-movement command, which
   causes the command to be executed, or by hitting <Esc> "v", "V" or "CTRL-V"
   (see |v_v|), which just stops Visual mode without side effects.
*3 Go from Command-line mode to Normal mode by:
   - Hitting <CR> or <NL>, which causes the entered command to be executed.
   - Deleting the complete line (e.g., with CTRL-U) and giving a final <BS>.
   - Hitting CTRL-C or <Esc>, which quits the command-line without executing
     the command.
   In the last case <Esc> may be the character defined with the 'wildchar'
   option, in which case it will start command-line completion.  You can
   ignore that and type <Esc> again.
*4 Go from Normal to Select mode by:
   - use the mouse to select text while 'selectmode' contains "mouse"
   - use a non-printable command to move the cursor while keeping the Shift
     key pressed, and the 'selectmode' option contains "key"
   - use "v", "V" or "CTRL-V" while 'selectmode' contains "cmd"
   - use "gh", "gH" or "g CTRL-H"  |g_CTRL-H|
*5 Go from Select mode to Normal mode by using a non-printable command to move
   the cursor, without keeping the Shift key pressed.
*6 Go from Select mode to Insert mode by typing a printable character.  The
   selection is deleted and the character is inserted.

If the 'insertmode' option is on, editing a file will start in Insert mode.

	*CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *i_CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *c_CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *v_CTRL-\_CTRL-N*
Additionally the command CTRL-\ CTRL-N or <C-\><C-N> can be used to go to
Normal mode from any other mode.  This can be used to make sure Vim is in
Normal mode, without causing a beep like <Esc> would.  However, this does not
work in Ex mode.  When used after a command that takes an argument, such as
|f| or |m|, the timeout set with 'ttimeoutlen' applies.
When focus is in a terminal window, CTRL-\ CTRL-N goes to Normal mode until an
edit command is entered, see |t_CTRL-\_CTRL-N|.

	*CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *i_CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *c_CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *v_CTRL-\_CTRL-G*
The command CTRL-\ CTRL-G or <C-\><C-G> can be used to go to Insert mode when
'insertmode' is set.  Otherwise it goes to Normal mode.  This can be used to
make sure Vim is in the mode indicated by 'insertmode', without knowing in
what mode Vim currently is.

				    *Q* *mode-Ex* *Ex-mode* *Ex* *EX* *E501*
Q			Switch to "Ex" mode.  This is a bit like typing ":"
			commands one after another, except:
			- You don't have to keep pressing ":".
			- The screen doesn't get updated after each command.
			- There is no normal command-line editing.
			- Mappings and abbreviations are not used.
			In fact, you are editing the lines with the "standard"
			line-input editing commands (<Del> or <BS> to erase,
			CTRL-U to kill the whole line).
			Vim will enter this mode by default if it's invoked as
			"ex" on the command-line or the |-e| command line
			argument was used.
			Use the ":vi" command |:visual| to exit "Ex" mode.
			Note: In older versions of Vim "Q" formatted text,
			that is now done with |gq|.  But if you use the
			|vimrc_example.vim| script or |defaults.vim|, "Q"
			works like "gq".  Except for Select mode.

					*gQ*
gQ			Switch to "Ex" mode like with "Q", but really behave
			like typing ":" commands after another.  All command
			line editing, completion etc. is available.
			Use the `:vi` command (`:visual`) to exit "Ex" mode.

==============================================================================
7. The window contents					*window-contents*

In Normal mode and Insert/Replace mode the screen window will show the current
contents of the buffer: What You See Is What You Get.  There are two
exceptions:
- When the 'cpoptions' option contains '$', and the change is within one line,
  the text is not directly deleted, but a '$' is put at the last deleted
  character.
- When inserting text in one window, other windows on the same text are not
  updated until the insert is finished.

Lines longer than the window width will wrap, unless the 'wrap' option is off
(see below).  The 'linebreak' option can be set to wrap at a blank character.

If the window has room after the last line of the buffer, Vim will show '~' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|some line		|
	|last line		|
	|~			|
	|~			|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '~' lines indicate that the end of the buffer was reached.

If the last line in a window doesn't fit, Vim will indicate this with a '@' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|first line		|
	|second line		|
	|@			|
	|@			|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '@' lines indicate that there is a line that doesn't fit in the
window.

When the "lastline" flag is present in the 'display' option, you will not see
'@' characters at the left side of window.  If the last line doesn't fit
completely, only the part that fits is shown, and the last three characters of
the last line are replaced with "@@@", like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|first line		|
	|second line		|
	|a very long line that d|
	|oesn't fit in the wi@@@|
	+-----------------------+

If there is a single line that is too long to fit in the window, this is a
special situation.  Vim will show only part of the line, around where the
cursor is.  There are no special characters shown, so that you can edit all
parts of this line.

The '@' occasion in the 'highlight' option can be used to set special
highlighting for the '@' and '~' characters.  This makes it possible to
distinguish them from real characters in the buffer.

The 'showbreak' option contains the string to put in front of wrapped lines.

							*wrap-off*
If the 'wrap' option is off, long lines will not wrap.  Only the part that
fits on the screen is shown.  If the cursor is moved to a part of the line
that is not shown, the screen is scrolled horizontally.  The advantage of
this method is that columns are shown as they are and lines that cannot fit
on the screen can be edited.  The disadvantage is that you cannot see all the
characters of a line at once.  The 'sidescroll' option can be set to the
minimal number of columns to scroll.

All normal ASCII characters are displayed directly on the screen.  The <Tab>
is replaced with the number of spaces that it represents.  Other non-printing
characters are replaced with "^{char}", where {char} is the non-printing
character with 64 added.  Thus character 7 (bell) will be shown as "^G".
Characters between 127 and 160 are replaced with "~{char}", where {char} is
the character with 64 subtracted.  These characters occupy more than one
position on the screen.  The cursor can only be positioned on the first one.

If you set the 'number' option, all lines will be preceded with their
number.  Tip: If you don't like wrapping lines to mix with the line numbers,
set the 'showbreak' option to eight spaces:
	":set showbreak=\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "

If you set the 'list' option, <Tab> characters will not be shown as several
spaces, but as "^I".  A '$' will be placed at the end of the line, so you can
find trailing blanks.

In Command-line mode only the command-line itself is shown correctly.  The
display of the buffer contents is updated as soon as you go back to Command
mode.

The last line of the window is used for status and other messages.  The
status messages will only be used if an option is on:

status message			option	     default	Unix default	~
current mode			'showmode'	on	    on
command characters		'showcmd'	on	    off
cursor position			'ruler'		off	    off

The current mode is "-- INSERT --" or "-- REPLACE --", see |'showmode'|.  The
command characters are those that you typed but were not used yet.

If you have a slow terminal you can switch off the status messages to speed
up editing:
	:set nosc noru nosm

If there is an error, an error message will be shown for at least one second
(in reverse video).

Some commands show how many lines were affected.  Above which threshold this
happens can be controlled with the 'report' option (default 2).

On the Amiga Vim will run in a CLI window.  The name Vim and the full name of
the current file name will be shown in the title bar.  When the window is
resized, Vim will automatically redraw the window.  You may make the window as
small as you like, but if it gets too small not a single line will fit in it.
Make it at least 40 characters wide to be able to read most messages on the
last line.

On most Unix systems, resizing the window is recognized and handled correctly
by Vim.

8. Definitions						*definitions*

  buffer		Contains lines of text, usually read from a file.
  screen		The whole area that Vim uses to work in.  This can be
			a terminal emulator window.  Also called "the Vim
			window".
  window		A view on a buffer.  There can be multiple windows for
			one buffer.

A screen contains one or more windows, separated by status lines and with the
command line at the bottom.

	+-------------------------------+
screen	| window 1	| window 2	|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|= status line =|= status line =|
	| window 3			|
	|				|
	|				|
	|==== status line ==============|
	|command line			|
	+-------------------------------+

The command line is also used for messages.  It scrolls up the screen when
there is not enough room in the command line.

A difference is made between four types of lines:

  buffer lines		The lines in the buffer.  This is the same as the
			lines as they are read from/written to a file.  They
			can be thousands of characters long.
  logical lines		The buffer lines with folding applied.  Buffer lines
			in a closed fold are changed to a single logical line:
			"+-- 99 lines folded".  They can be thousands of
			characters long.
  window lines		The lines displayed in a window: A range of logical
			lines with wrapping, line breaks, etc.  applied.  They
			can only be as long as the width of the window allows,
			longer lines are wrapped or truncated.
  screen lines		The lines of the screen that Vim uses.  Consists of
			the window lines of all windows, with status lines
			and the command line added.  They can only be as long
			as the width of the screen allows.  When the command
			line gets longer it wraps and lines are scrolled to
			make room.

==============================================================================
1. Key mapping				*key-mapping* *mapping* *macro*

Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys.  The most common use
is to define a sequence of commands for a function key.  Example: >

	:map <F2> a<C-R>=strftime("%c")<CR><Esc>

This appends the current date and time after the cursor (in <> notation |<>|).


1.1 MAP COMMANDS					*:map-commands*

There are commands to enter new mappings, remove mappings and list mappings.
See |map-overview| for the various forms of "map" and their relationships with
modes.

{lhs}	means left-hand-side	*{lhs}*
{rhs}	means right-hand-side	*{rhs}*

:map	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-nvo|		*:map*
:nm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-n|		*:nm* *:nmap*
:vm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-v|		*:vm* *:vmap*
:xm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-x|		*:xm* *:xmap*
:smap	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-s|		    *:smap*
:om[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-o|		*:om* *:omap*
:map!	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-ic|		*:map!*
:im[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-i|		*:im* *:imap*
:lm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-l|		*:lm* *:lma* *:lmap*
:cm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-c|		*:cm* *:cmap*
:tma[p]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-t|		*:tma* *:tmap*
			Map the key sequence {lhs} to {rhs} for the modes
			where the map command applies.  The result, including
			{rhs}, is then further scanned for mappings.  This
			allows for nested and recursive use of mappings.
			Note: Trailing spaces are included in the {rhs},
			because space is a valid Normal mode command.
			See |map-trailing-white|.

						*:nore* *:norem*
:no[remap]  {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-nvo|	*:no*  *:noremap* *:nor*
:nn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-n|	*:nn*  *:nnoremap*
:vn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-v|	*:vn*  *:vnoremap*
:xn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-x|	*:xn*  *:xnoremap*
:snor[emap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-s|	*:snor* *:snore* *:snoremap*
:ono[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-o|	*:ono* *:onoremap*
:no[remap]! {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-ic|	*:no!* *:noremap!*
:ino[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-i|	*:ino* *:inor* *:inoremap*
:ln[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-l|	*:ln*  *:lnoremap*
:cno[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-c|	*:cno* *:cnor* *:cnoremap*
:tno[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-t|	*:tno* *:tnoremap*
			Map the key sequence {lhs} to {rhs} for the modes
			where the map command applies.  Disallow mapping of
			{rhs}, to avoid nested and recursive mappings.  Often
			used to redefine a command.
			Note: When <Plug> appears in the {rhs} this part is
			always applied even if remapping is disallowed.


:unm[ap]  {lhs}			|mapmode-nvo|		*:unm*  *:unmap*
:nun[map] {lhs}			|mapmode-n|		*:nun*  *:nunmap*
:vu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-v|		*:vu*   *:vunmap*
:xu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-x|		*:xu*   *:xunmap*
:sunm[ap] {lhs}			|mapmode-s|		*:sunm* *:sunmap*
:ou[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-o|		*:ou*   *:ounmap*
:unm[ap]! {lhs}			|mapmode-ic|		*:unm!* *:unmap!*
:iu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-i|		*:iu*   *:iunmap*
:lu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-l|		*:lu*   *:lunmap*
:cu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-c|		*:cu*   *:cun* *:cunmap*
:tunma[p] {lhs}			|mapmode-t|		*:tunma* *:tunmap*
			Remove the mapping of {lhs} for the modes where the
			map command applies.  The mapping may remain defined
			for other modes where it applies.
			It also works when {lhs} matches the {rhs} of a
			mapping. This is for when an abbreviation applied.
			Note: Trailing spaces are included in the {lhs}.
			See |map-trailing-white|.

:mapc[lear]			|mapmode-nvo|		*:mapc*   *:mapclear*
:nmapc[lear]			|mapmode-n|		*:nmapc*  *:nmapclear*
:vmapc[lear]			|mapmode-v|		*:vmapc*  *:vmapclear*
:xmapc[lear]			|mapmode-x|		*:xmapc*  *:xmapclear*
:smapc[lear]			|mapmode-s|		*:smapc*  *:smapclear*

:cmapc[lear]			|mapmode-c|		*:cmapc*  *:cmapclear*
:tmapc[lear]			|mapmode-t|		*:tmapc*  *:tmapclear*
			Remove ALL mappings for the modes where the map
			command applies.
			Use the <buffer> argument to remove buffer-local
			mappings |:map-<buffer>|
			Warning: This also removes the |mac-standard-mappings|
			and the |dos-standard-mappings|.

:im[ap]				|mapmode-i|
:lm[ap]				|mapmode-l|
:cm[ap]				|mapmode-c|
:tma[p]				|mapmode-t|
			List all key mappings for the modes where the map
			command applies.  Note that ":map" and ":map!" are
			used most often, because they include the other modes.

:cm[ap] {lhs}			|mapmode-c|		*:cmap_l*
:tma[p] {lhs}			|mapmode-t|		*:tmap_l*
			List the key mappings for the key sequences starting
			with {lhs} in the modes where the map command applies.

These commands are used to map a key or key sequence to a string of
characters.  You can use this to put command sequences under function keys,
translate one key into another, etc.  See |:mkexrc| for how to save and
restore the current mappings.

							*map-ambiguous*
When two mappings start with the same sequence of characters, they are
ambiguous.  Example: >
	:imap aa foo
	:imap aaa bar
When Vim has read "aa", it will need to get another character to be able to
decide if "aa" or "aaa" should be mapped.  This means that after typing "aa"
that mapping won't get expanded yet, Vim is waiting for another character.
If you type a space, then "foo" will get inserted, plus the space.  If you
type "a", then "bar" will get inserted.

Trailing white space ~
							*map-trailing-white*
This unmap command does NOT work: >
	:map @@ foo
	:unmap @@ | print

Because it tries to unmap "@@ ", including the white space before the command
separator "|".  Other examples with trailing white space: >
	unmap @@ 
	unmap @@     # Vim9 script comment
	unmap @@     " legacy script comment

An error will be issued, which is very hard to identify, because the ending
whitespace character in `unmap @@ ` is not visible.

A generic solution is to put the command separator "|" right after the mapped
keys.  After that white space and a comment may follow: >

	unmap @@|    # Vim9 script comment
	unmap @@|    " legacy script comment


1.2 SPECIAL ARGUMENTS					*:map-arguments*

"<buffer>", "<nowait>", "<silent>", "<special>", "<script>", "<expr>" and
"<unique>" can be used in any order.  They must appear right after the
command, before any other arguments.

				    *:map-local* *:map-<buffer>* *:map-buffer*
				    *E224* *E225*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<buffer>" the mapping will
be effective in the current buffer only.  Example: >
	:map <buffer>  ,w  /[.,;]<CR>
Then you can map ",w" to something else in another buffer: >
	:map <buffer>  ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
The local buffer mappings are used before the global ones.  See <nowait> below
to make a short local mapping not taking effect when a longer global one
exists.
The "<buffer>" argument can also be used to clear mappings: >
	:unmap <buffer> ,w
	:mapclear <buffer>
Local mappings are also cleared when a buffer is deleted, but not when it is
unloaded.  Just like local option values.
Also see |map-precedence|.

						*:map-<nowait>* *:map-nowait*
When defining a buffer-local mapping for "," there may be a global mapping
that starts with ",".  Then you need to type another character for Vim to know
whether to use the "," mapping or the longer one.  To avoid this add the
<nowait> argument.  Then the mapping will be used when it matches, Vim does
not wait for more characters to be typed.  However, if the characters were
already typed they are used.
Note that this works when the <nowait> mapping fully matches and is found
before any partial matches.  This works when:
- There is only one matching buffer-local mapping, since these are always
  found before global mappings.
- There is another buffer-local mapping that partly matches, but it is
  defined earlier (last defined mapping is found first).

						*:map-<silent>* *:map-silent*
To define a mapping which will not be echoed on the command line, add
"<silent>" as the first argument.  Example: >
	:map <silent> ,h /Header<CR>
The search string will not be echoed when using this mapping.  Messages from
the executed command are still given though.  To shut them up too, add a
":silent" in the executed command: >
	:map <silent> ,h :exe ":silent normal /Header\r"<CR>
Note that the effect of a command might also be silenced, e.g., when the
mapping selects another entry for command line completion it won't be
displayed.
Prompts will still be given, e.g., for inputdialog().
Using "<silent>" for an abbreviation is possible, but will cause redrawing of
the command line to fail.

						*:map-<special>* *:map-special*
Define a mapping with <> notation for special keys, even though the "<" flag
may appear in 'cpoptions'.  This is useful if the side effect of setting
'cpoptions' is not desired.  Example: >
	:map <special> <F12> /Header<CR>
<
						*:map-<script>* *:map-script*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<script>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the mapping will only remap characters
in the {rhs} using mappings that were defined local to a script, starting with
"<SID>".  This can be used to avoid that mappings from outside a script
interfere (e.g., when CTRL-V is remapped in mswin.vim), but do use other
mappings defined in the script.
Note: ":map <script>" and ":noremap <script>" do the same thing.  The
"<script>" overrules the command name.  Using ":noremap <script>" is
preferred, because it's clearer that remapping is (mostly) disabled.

				*:map-<unique>* *:map-unique* *E226* *E227*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<unique>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the command will fail if the mapping or
abbreviation already exists.  Example: >
	:map <unique> ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
When defining a local mapping, there will also be a check if a global map
already exists which is equal.
Example of what will fail: >
	:map ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
	:map <buffer> <unique> ,w  /[.,;]<CR>
