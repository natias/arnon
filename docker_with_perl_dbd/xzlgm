operation would mix Unicode and locale rules, which likely conflict.
Mixing of different rule types is forbidden, so the operation was not
done; instead the result is the indicated value, which is the best
available that uses entirely Unicode rules.  That turns out to almost
always be the original character, unchanged.

It is generally a bad idea to mix non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode, and
this issue is one of the reasons why.  This warning is raised when
Unicode rules would normally cause the result of this operation to
contain a character that is in the range specified by the locale,
0..255, and hence is subject to the locale's rules, not Unicode's.

If you are using locale purely for its characteristics related to things
like its numeric and time formatting (and not C<LC_CTYPE>), consider
using a restricted form of the locale pragma (see L<perllocale/The "use
locale" pragma>) like "S<C<use locale ':not_characters'>>".

Note that failed case-changing operations done as a result of
case-insensitive C</i> regular expression matching will show up in this
warning as having the C<fc> operation (as that is what the regular
expression engine calls behind the scenes.)

=item Can't do waitpid with flags

(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only
waitpid() without flags is emulated.

=item Can't emulate -%s on #! line

(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this
point.  For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a B<-x> on the #!
line.

=item Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform

(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian,
or it has a very strange pointer size.  Packing and unpacking big- or
little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible.
See L<perlfunc/pack>.

=item Can't exec "%s": %s

(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the
permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
C<$ENV{PATH}>, the executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that
can't be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support
#! at all.)

=item Can't exec %s

(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
that's what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may
need to mention "perl" on the #! line somewhere.

=item Can't execute %s

(F) You used the B<-S> switch, but the copies of the script to execute
found in the PATH did not have correct permissions.

=item Can't find an opnumber for "%s"

(F) A string of a form C<CORE::word> was given to prototype(), but there
is no builtin with the name C<word>.

=item Can't find label %s

(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's
possible for us to go to.  See L<perlfunc/goto>.

=item Can't find %s on PATH

(F) You used the B<-S> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH.

=item Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH

(F) You used the B<-S> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.

=item Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF

(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:

    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);

If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may have
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or there
may not be a linebreak after it.  A good programmer's editor will have
a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).  See
L<perlop> for the full details on here-documents.

=item Can't find Unicode property definition "%s"

=item Can't find Unicode property definition "%s" in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/

(F) The named property which you specified via C<\p> or C<\P> is not one
known to Perl.  Perhaps you misspelled the name?  See
L<perluniprops/Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}>
for a complete list of available official
properties.  If it is a
L<user-defined property|perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>
it must have been defined by the time the regular expression is
matched.

If you didn't mean to use a Unicode property, escape the C<\p>, either
by C<\\p> (just the C<\p>) or by C<\Q\p> (the rest of the string, or
until C<\E>).

=item Can't fork: %s

(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a
pipeline.

=item Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds

(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will be retried
after five seconds.

=item Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?

(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl C<stat> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)

=item Can't get pipe mailbox device name

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.

=item Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.

=item Can't "goto" into a binary or list expression

(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a binary
or list expression.  You can't get there from here.  The reason for this
restriction is that the interpreter would get confused as to how many
arguments there are, resulting in stack corruption or crashes.  This
error occurs in cases such as these:

    goto F;
    print do { F: }; # Can't jump into the arguments to print

    goto G;
    $x + do { G: $y }; # How is + supposed to get its first operand?

=item Can't "goto" into a "defer" block

(F) A C<goto> statement was executed to jump into the scope of a C<defer>
block.  This is not permitted.

=item Can't "goto" into a "given" block

(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a C<given>
block.  You can't get there from here.  See L<perlfunc/goto>.

=item Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop

(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can't get there from here.  See L<perlfunc/goto>.

=item Can't "goto" out of a pseudo block

(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See L<perlfunc/goto>.

=item Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s

(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval
"string" or block.

=item Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)

(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a sort(), or from a similar callback (such
as the reduce() function in List::Util).

=item Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine

(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See L<perlfunc/goto>.

=item Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default

(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.

=item Can't kill a non-numeric process ID

(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers.  It is a fatal error to
attempt to kill() an undefined, empty-string or otherwise non-numeric
process identifier.

=item Can't "last" outside a loop block

(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current
block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a "loopish"
block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
L<perlfunc/last>.

=item Can't linearize anonymous symbol table

(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, but failed because the package stash has no name.

=item Can't load '%s' for module %s

(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension.
This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one
that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known
to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your
dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library
that is installed on your system.  You may need to rebuild your old
dynamic extensions.

=item Can't localize lexical variable %s

(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using "my" or "state".  This is not allowed.  If you
want to localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with
the package name.

=item Can't localize through a reference

(F) You said something like C<local $$ref>, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.

=item Can't locate %s

(F) You said to C<do> (or C<require>, or C<use>) a file that couldn't be found.
Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless
the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need
to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the
extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
L<perlfunc/require> and L<lib>.

=item Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC

(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to C<AutoSplit>
the file, say, by doing C<make install>.

=item Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC

(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like
for example, F<foo.so> or F<bar.dll>, but the L<DynaLoader> module was
unable to locate this library.  See L<DynaLoader>.

=item Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"

(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See L<perlobj>.

=item Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s" (perhaps you forgot
to load "%s"?)

(F) You called a method on a class that did not exist, and the method
could not be found in UNIVERSAL.  This often means that a method
requires a package that has not been loaded.

=item Can't locate object method "INC", nor "INCDIR" nor string overload via package "%s" %s in @INC

(F) You pushed an object, either directly or via an array reference hook,
into C<@INC>, but the object doesn't support any known hook methods, nor
a string overload and is also not a blessed CODE reference. In short the
C<require> function does not know what to do with the object.
See also L<perlfunc/require>.

=item Attempt to call undefined %s method with arguments ("%s"%s)
via package "%s" (Perhaps you forgot to load the package?)

(D deprecated::missing_import_called_with_args) You called the
C<import()> or C<unimport()> method of a class that has no import method
defined in its inheritance graph, and passed an argument to the method.
This is very often the sign of a mispelled package name in a use or
require statement that has silently succeded due to a case insensitive
file system.

Another common reason this may happen is when mistakenly attempting to
import or unimport a symbol from a class definition or package which
does not use C<Exporter> or otherwise define its own C<import> or
C<unimport> method.

=item Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA

(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that
doesn't seem to exist.

=item Can't locate PerlIO%s

(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
e.g. open(FH, ">:nosuchlayer", "somefile").

=item Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system

(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.

=item Can't make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s

(S) A module passed the flag 0x01 to DynaLoader::dl_load_file() to request
that symbols from the stated file are made available globally within the
process, but that functionality is not available on this platform.  Whilst
the module likely will still work, this may prevent the perl interpreter
from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link directly to
functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.

=item Can't modify %s in %s

(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.

=item Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &%s

=item Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &%s in %s

(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such.  See L<perlsub/"Lvalue subroutines">.

=item Can't modify reference to %s in %s assignment

(F) Only a limited number of constructs can be used as the argument to a
reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment, and what
you used was not one of them.  See L<perlref/Assigning to References>.

=item Can't modify reference to localized parenthesized array in list
assignment

(F) Assigning to C<\local(@array)> or C<\(local @array)> is not supported, as
it is not clear exactly what it should do.  If you meant to make @array
refer to some other array, use C<\@array = \@other_array>.  If you want to
make the elements of @array aliases of the scalars referenced on the
right-hand side, use C<\(@array) = @scalar_refs>.

=item Can't modify reference to parenthesized hash in list assignment

(F) Assigning to C<\(%hash)> is not supported.  If you meant to make %hash
refer to some other hash, use C<\%hash = \%other_hash>.  If you want to
make the elements of %hash into aliases of the scalars referenced on the
right-hand side, use a hash slice: C<\@hash{@keys} = @those_scalar_refs>.

=item Can't msgrcv to read-only var

(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.

=item Can't "next" outside a loop block

(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See L<perlfunc/next>.

=item Can't open %s: %s

(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the C<< <> >>
filehandle, either implicitly under the C<-n> or C<-p> command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually
this is because you don't have read permission for a file which
you named on the command line.

(F) You tried to call perl with the B<-e> switch, but F</dev/null> (or
your operating system's equivalent) could not be opened.

=item Can't open a reference

(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing,
using the 3-arg open() syntax:

    open FH, '>', $ref;

but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.

=item Can't open bidirectional pipe

(W pipe) You tried to say C<open(CMD, "|cmd|")>, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using
">", and then read it in under a different file handle.

=item Can't open error file %s as stderr

(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2>' or '2>>' on
the command line for writing.

=item Can't open input file %s as stdin

(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '<' on the
command line for reading.

=item Can't open output file %s as stdout

(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '>' or '>>' on
the command line for writing.

=item Can't open output pipe (name: %s)

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined
for stdout.

=item Can't open perl script "%s": %s

(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.

If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell's $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so
you don't have to type the path or C<`which $scriptname`>.

=item Can't read CRTL environ

(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define F<PERL_ENV_TABLES> (see L<perlvms>) so that environ is not
searched.

=item Can't redeclare "%s" in "%s"

(F) A "my", "our" or "state" declaration was found within another declaration,
such as C<my ($x, my($y), $z)> or C<our (my $x)>.

=item Can't "redo" outside a loop block

(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See L<perlfunc/redo>.

=item Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file

(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.

=item Can't rename in-place work file '%s' to '%s': %s

(F) When closed implicitly, the temporary file for in-place editing
couldn't be renamed to the original filename.

=item Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file

(F) The rename done by the B<-i> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.

=item Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode

(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.

=item Can't represent character for Ox%X on this platform

(F) There is a hard limit to how big a character code point can be due
to the fundamental properties of UTF-8, especially on EBCDIC
platforms.  The given code point exceeds that.  The only work-around is
to not use such a large code point.

=item Can't reset %ENV on this system

(F) You called C<reset('E')> or similar, which tried to reset
all variables in the current package beginning with "E".  In
the main package, that includes %ENV.  Resetting %ENV is not
supported on some systems, notably VMS.

=item Can't resolve method "%s" overloading "%s" in package "%s"

(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package.  If the method name is C<???>, this is an internal error.

=item Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine

(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.

=item Can't return outside a subroutine

(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See L<perlsub>.

=item Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context

(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl
think you meant to return only one value.  You probably meant to
write parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.

=item Can't take log of %g

(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.

=item Can't take sqrt of %g

(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.

=item Can't undef active subroutine

(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.

=item Can't unweaken a nonreference

(F) You attempted to unweaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be unweakened.

=item Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d

(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.

=item Can't use '%c' after -mname

(F) You tried to call perl with the B<-m> switch, but you put something
other than "=" after the module name.

=item Can't use a hash as a reference

(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
C<< %foo->{"bar"} >> or C<< %$ref->{"hello"} >>.  Versions of perl
<= 5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't
have.  This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.

=item Can't use an array as a reference

(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
C<< @foo->[23] >> or C<< @$ref->[99] >>.  Versions of perl <= 5.22.0
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.  This
was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.

=item Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup

(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: C<undef %Some::Package::>.

=item Can't use an undefined value as %s reference

(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.

=item Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use

(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See L<perlref>.

=item Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available

(F) The first time the C<%!> hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module.  The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for C<$!> errno values.

=item Can't use both '<' and '>' after type '%c' in %s

(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
allowed.  See L<perlfunc/pack>.

=item Can't use 'defined(@array)' (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)

(F) defined() is not useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined I<scalar> value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use C<if (@array) { # not empty }> for example.

=item Can't use 'defined(%hash)' (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)

(F) C<defined()> is not usually right on hashes.

Although C<defined %hash> is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it
becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators,
weak references, stash names, even remaining true after C<undef %hash>.
These things make C<defined %hash> fairly useless in practice, so it now
generates a fatal error.

If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean
context (see L<perldata/Scalar values>):

    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }

If you had C<defined %Foo::Bar::QUUX> to check whether such a package
variable exists then that's never really been reliable, and isn't
a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether
it's loaded, etc.

=item Can't use %s for loop variable

(P) The parser got confused when trying to parse a C<foreach> loop.

=item Can't use global %s in %s

(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.

=item Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s

(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that
is inside a big-endian group.

=item Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison

(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the <=> or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.

=item Can't use %s ref as %s ref

(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.

=item Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use

=item Can't use string ("%s"...) as %s ref while "strict refs" in use

(F) You've told Perl to dereference a string, something which
C<use strict> blocks to prevent it happening accidentally.  See
L<perlref/"Symbolic references">.  This can be triggered by an C<@> or C<$>
in a double-quoted string immediately before interpolating a variable,
for example in C<"user @$twitter_id">, which says to treat the contents
of C<$twitter_id> as an array reference; use a C<\> to have a literal C<@>
symbol followed by the contents of C<$twitter_id>: C<"user \@$twitter_id">.

=item Can't use subscript on %s

(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.

=item Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression

(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.

=item Can't weaken a nonreference

(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.

=item Can't "when" outside a topicalizer

(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a C<foreach>
loop nor a C<given> block.  (Note that this error is issued on exit
from the C<when> block, so you won't get the error if the match fails,
or if you use an explicit C<continue>.)

=item Can't x= to read-only value

(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.

=item catch block requires a (VAR)

(F) You tried to use the C<try> and C<catch> syntax of C<use feature 'try'>
but did not include the error variable in the C<catch> block. The
parenthesized variable name is not optional, unlike in some other forms of
syntax you may be familiar with from CPAN modules or other languages.

The required syntax is

    try { ... }
    catch ($var) { ... }

=item Changing use VERSION while another use VERSION is in scope is now deprecated

(W deprecated) Once you have a C<use VERSION> statement in scope, any
C<use VERSION> statement that requests a different version is now deprecated,
due to the increasing complexity of swapping from one prevailing version to
another.

It is suggested that you do not try to mix multiple different version
declarations within the same file as it leads to complex behaviours about the
visibility of features and builtin functions, as well as confusing human
readers.

If it is essential to have different C<use VERSION> declarations in different
regions of the same file, you should surround each one by its own enclosing
scope so the two do not mix.

  {
    use v5.20;
    ...
  }
  {
    use v5.36;
    ...
  }

=item Character following "\c" must be printable ASCII

(F) In C<\cI<X>>, I<X> must be a printable (non-control) ASCII character.

Note that ASCII characters that don't map to control characters are
discouraged, and will generate the warning (when enabled)
L</""\c%c" is more clearly written simply as "%s"">.

=item Character following \%c must be '{' or a single-character Unicode property name in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/

(F) (In the above the C<%c> is replaced by either C<p> or C<P>.)  You
specified something that isn't a legal Unicode property name.  Most
Unicode properties are specified by C<\p{...}>.  But if the name is a
single character one, the braces may be omitted.

=item Character in 'C' format wrapped in pack

(W pack) You said

    pack("C", $x)

where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255; the C<"C"> format is
only for encoding native operating system characters (ASCII, EBCDIC,
and so on) and not for Unicode characters, so Perl behaved as if you meant

    pack("C", $x & 255)

If you actually want to pack Unicode codepoints, use the C<"U"> format
instead.

=item Character in 'c' format wrapped in pack

(W pack) You said

    pack("c", $x)

where $x is either less than -128 or more than 127; the C<"c"> format
is only for encoding native operating system characters (ASCII, EBCDIC,
and so on) and not for Unicode characters, so Perl behaved as if you meant

    pack("c", $x & 255);

If you actually want to pack Unicode codepoints, use the C<"U"> format
instead.

=item Character in '%c' format wrapped in unpack

(W unpack) You tried something like

   unpack("H", "\x{2a1}")

where the format expects to process a byte (a character with a value
below 256), but a higher value was provided instead.  Perl uses the
value modulus 256 instead, as if you had provided:

   unpack("H", "\x{a1}")

=item Character in 'W' format wrapped in pack

(W pack) You said

    pack("U0W", $x)

where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255.  However, C<U0>-mode
expects all values to fall in the interval [0, 255], so Perl behaved
as if you meant:

    pack("U0W", $x & 255)

=item Character(s) in '%c' format wrapped in pack

(W pack) You tried something like

   pack("u", "\x{1f3}b")

where the format expects to process a sequence of bytes (character with a
value below 256), but some of the characters had a higher value.  Perl
uses the character values modulus 256 instead, as if you had provided:

   pack("u", "\x{f3}b")

=item Character(s) in '%c' format wrapped in unpack

(W unpack) You tried something like

   unpack("s", "\x{1f3}b")

where the format expects to process a sequence of bytes (character with a
value below 256), but some of the characters had a higher value.  Perl
uses the character values modulus 256 instead, as if you had provided:

   unpack("s", "\x{f3}b")

=item charnames alias definitions may not contain a sequence of multiple
spaces; marked by S<<-- HERE> in %s

(F) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters
in a row.  Change them to single spaces.  Usually these names are
defined in the C<:alias> import argument to C<use charnames>, but they
could be defined by a translator installed into C<$^H{charnames}>.  See
L<charnames/CUSTOM ALIASES>.

=item chdir() on unopened filehandle %s

(W unopened) You tried chdir() on a filehandle that was never opened.

=item "\c%c" is more clearly written simply as "%s"

(W syntax) The C<\cI<X>> construct is intended to be a way to specify
non-printable characters.  You used it for a printable one, which
is better written as simply itself, perhaps preceded by a backslash
for non-word characters.  Doing it the way you did is not portable
between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.

=item Class already has a superclass, cannot add another

(F) You attempted to specify a second superclass for a C<class> by using
the C<:isa> attribute, when one is already specified.  Unlike classes
whose instances are created with C<bless>, classes created via the
C<class> keyword cannot have more than one superclass.

=item Class attribute %s requires a value

(F) You specified an attribute for a class that would require a value to
be passed in parentheses, but did not provide one.  Remember that
whitespace is B<not> permitted between the attribute name and its value;
you must write this as

    class Example::Class :attr(VALUE) ...

=item class is experimental

(S experimental::class) This warning is emitted if you use the C<class>
keyword of C<use feature 'class'>.  This keyword is currently
experimental and its behaviour may change in future releases of Perl.

=item Class :isa attribute requires a class but "%s" is not one

(F) When creating a subclass using the C<class> C<:isa> attribute, the
named superclass must also be a real class created using the C<class>
keyword.

=item Cloning substitution context is unimplemented

(F) Creating a new thread inside the C<s///> operator is not supported.

=item closedir() attempted on invalid dirhandle %s

(W io) The dirhandle you tried to close is either closed or not really
a dirhandle.  Check your control flow.

=item close() on unopened filehandle %s

(W unopened) You tried to close a filehandle that was never opened.

=item Closure prototype called

(F) If a closure has attributes, the subroutine passed to an attribute
handler is the prototype that is cloned when a new closure is created.
This subroutine cannot be called.

=item \C no longer supported in regex; marked by S<<-- HERE> in m/%s/

(F) The \C character class used to allow a match of single byte
within a multi-byte utf-8 character, but was removed in v5.24 as
it broke encapsulation and its implementation was extremely buggy.
If you really need to process the individual bytes, you probably
want to convert your string to one where each underlying byte is
stored as a character, with utf8::encode().

=item Code missing after '/'

(F) You had a (sub-)template that ends with a '/'.  There must be
another template code following the slash.  See L<perlfunc/pack>.

=item Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable

(S non_unicode portable) You had a code point that has never been in any
standard, so it is likely that languages other than Perl will NOT
understand it.  This code point also will not fit in a 32-bit word on
ASCII platforms and therefore is non-portable between systems.

At one time, it was legal in some standards to have code points up to
0x7FFF_FFFF, but not higher, and this code point is higher.

Acceptance of these code points is a Perl extension, and you should
expect that nothing other than Perl can handle them; Perl itself on
EBCDIC platforms before v5.24 does not handle them.

Perl also makes no guarantees that the representation of these code
points won't change at some point in the future, say when machines
become available that have larger than a 64-bit word.  At that time,
files containing any of these, written by an older Perl might require
conversion before being readable by a newer Perl.

=item Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, may not be portable

(S non_unicode) You had a code point above the Unicode maximum
of U+10FFFF.

Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, but
these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.  Further, even if
these languages/systems accept these large code points, they may have
chosen a different representation for them than the UTF-8-like one that
Perl has, which would mean files are not exchangeable between them and
Perl.

On EBCDIC platforms, code points above 0x3FFF_FFFF have a different
representation in Perl v5.24 than before, so any file containing these
that was written before that version will require conversion before
being readable by a later Perl.

=item %s: Command not found

(A) You've accidentally run your script through B<csh> or another shell
instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.  The #! line at the top of your file could look like

  #!/usr/bin/perl

=item %s: command not found

(A) You've accidentally run your script through B<bash> or another shell
instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.  The #! line at the top of your file could look like

  #!/usr/bin/perl

=item %s: command not found: %s

(A) You've accidentally run your script through B<zsh> or another shell
instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.  The #! line at the top of your file could look like

  #!/usr/bin/perl

=item Compilation failed in require

(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a C<require> statement.
Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it
encountered were severe enough to halt compilation immediately.

=item connect() on closed socket %s

(W closed) You tried to do a connect on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
L<perlfunc/connect>.
