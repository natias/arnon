Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.124 (after 6.2.121)(extra)
Problem:    Mac: Recursive use of M4FLAGS causes problems.  When running Vim
	    directly it can't find the runtime files.  (Emily Jackson)

Patch 6.2.138 (extra)
Problem:    Compilation problem on VMS with dynamic buffer on the stack.

	    check for the string length without an extra buffer.
Files:	    src/os_vms.c

Patch 6.2.139

Problem:    Mac: building without GUI through configure doesn't work.
	    When the system is slow, unpacking the resource file takes too
	    long.
Solution:   Don't always define FEAT_GUI_MAC when MACOS is defined, define it
	    in the Makefile.
	    Add a configure option to skip Darwin detection.
	    Use a Python script to unpack the resources to avoid a race
	    condition. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    Makefile, src/Makefile, src/auto/configure, src/configure.in,
	    src/dehqx.py, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.143

	    Also use ":normal!" instead of ":normal" to avoid mappings
	    getting in the way.
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.149
Problem:    When the cursor is on a line past 21,474,748 the indicated
	    percentage of the position is invalid.  With that many lines
	    "100%" causes a negative cursor line number, resulting in a crash.
	    (Daniel Goujot)

	    that Insert mode isn't started too early.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.152
Problem:    The cursor() function doesn't reset the column offset for
	    'virtualedit'.
Solution:   Reset the offset to zero. (Helmut Stiegler)
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.153
Problem:    Win32: ":lang german" doesn't use German messages.

Solution:   Redefine EINTR to WSAEINTR. (Mike Williams)
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.157
Problem:    Using "%p" in 'errorformat' gives a column number that is too

	    Koutsoloukas)
Files:	    src/quickfix.c

Patch 6.2.158
Problem:    The sed command on Solaris and HPUX doesn't work for a line that
	    doesn't end in a newline.
Solution:   Add a newline when feeding text to sed. (Mark Waggoner)
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/auto/configure

Patch 6.2.159
Problem:    When using expression folding and 'foldopen' is "undo" an undo
	    command doesn't always open the fold.
Solution:   Save and restore the KeyTyped variable when evaluating 'foldexpr'.
	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.160
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is "all" and 'selection' is "exclusive",
	    selecting a double-width character below a single-width character
	    may cause a crash.
Solution:   Avoid overflow on unsigned integer decrement. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.161 (extra)

Patch 6.2.162
Problem:    ":redraw" doesn't always display the text that includes the cursor
	    position, e.g. after ":call cursor(1, 0)". (Eugene Minkovskii)
Solution:   Call update_topline() before redrawing.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.164 (after 6.2.144)
Problem:    When "g:html_use_css" is set the HTML header generated by the
	    2html script is still wrong.
Solution:   Search for a string instead of jumping to a fixed line number.
	    Go to the start of the line before inserting the header.
	    (Jess Thrysoee)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.165
Problem:    The configure checks hang when using autoconf 2.57.
Solution:   Invoke AC_PROGRAM_EGREP to set $EGREP. (Aron Griffis)
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.166
Problem:    When $GZIP contains "-N" editing compressed files doesn't work

Patch 6.2.170
Problem:    When using Sun WorkShop the current directory isn't changed to
	    where the file is.
Solution:   Set the 'autochdir' option when using WorkShop.  And avoid using
	    the basename when 'autochdir' is not set.
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c, src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.171 (after 6.2.163)

Patch 6.2.185
Problem:    Restoring a session with zero-height windows does not work
	    properly. (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Accept a zero argument to ":resize" as intended.  Add a window
