License: AFL-3
 This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original
 work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
 has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright
 notice for the Original Work:
 .
     Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0
 .
  1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
     royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the
     duration of the copyright, to do the following:
     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as
        part of a collective work;
     b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the
        Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative
        Works") based upon the Original Work;
     c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
        Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your
        choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions,
        including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this
        Academic Free License;
     d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
     e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 .
  2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
     royalty-free, non- exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
     claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
     the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration
     of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and
     import the Original Work and Derivative Works.
 .
  3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
     preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
     and all available documentation describing how to modify the
     Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy
     of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of
     the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the
     right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
     copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
     calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for
     as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.
 .
  4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor
     the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of
     their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
     promote products derived from this Original Work without express
     prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated
     herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's
     trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
     intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,
     sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any
     patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section
     2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
     such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this
     License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing
     under terms different from this License any Original Work that
     Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
 .
  5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
     distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative
     Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works
     may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are
     distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as
     an application intended for use over a network. As an express
     condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any
     External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative
     Work as a distribution under section 1(c).
 .
  6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
     Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or
     trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as
     well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
     identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the
     Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
     prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
     recipients that You have modified the Original Work.
 .
  7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
     warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the
     patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor
     or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the
     permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent
     rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding
     sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an
     "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
     including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
     merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.  This
     DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
     License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this
     License except under this disclaimer.
 .
  8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
     theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
     otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any
     indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
     character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
     Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
     goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
     and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
     liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
     such limitation.
 .
  9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly
     assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and
     irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
     conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
     Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
     effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
     recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions
     your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1,
     including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the
     Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
     conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international
     treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright
     exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair
     dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no
     longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
     upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).
 .
 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
     automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights
     granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
     action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor
     or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
     patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
     alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work
     with other software or hardware.
 .
 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating
     to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
     jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
     conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
     jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
     application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
     International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
     Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its
     termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of
     copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This
     section shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this
     License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
     shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
     without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred
     in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
     action. This section shall survive the termination of this
     License.
 .
 13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable.
 .
 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
     License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a
     legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of
     the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any
     entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
     with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the
     power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
     such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
     of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
     beneficial ownership of such entity.
 .
 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
     otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and
     Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such
     uses by You.
 .
 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005
     Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or
     communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this
     License permits You to modify this License as applied to the
     Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the
     text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
     modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other
     original works of authorship subject to the following conditions:
     (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is
     the "Academic Free License" or "AFL" and you may not use those
     names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace
     the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice
     "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice
     of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this
     License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are
     open source software unless your Modified License has been
     approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its
     license review and certification process.
