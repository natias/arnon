Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: GNU privacy guard - network certificate management service
 dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading OpenPGP and X.509
 certificates, as well as updates and status signals related to those
 certificates.  For OpenPGP, this means pulling from the public
 HKP/HKPS keyservers, or from LDAP servers.  For X.509 this includes
 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status
 Protocol updates (OCSP).  It is capable of using Tor for network
 access.
 .
 dirmngr is used for network access by gpg, gpgsm, and dirmngr-client,
 among other tools.  Unless this package is installed, the parts of
 the GnuPG suite that try to interact with the network will fail.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing

Description: helper tools for all init systems
 This package contains helper tools that are necessary for switching between
 the various init systems that Debian contains (e. g. sysvinit or
 systemd). An example is deb-systemd-helper, a script that enables systemd unit
 files without depending on a running systemd.
 .
 It also includes the "service", "invoke-rc.d", and "update-rc.d" scripts which
 provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping
 services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.
 .
 While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT
 specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to
 include their helpers in this package.

 with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
 general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
 deflate but offers more dense compression.

 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).
