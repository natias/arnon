>&#13;The glob file is a simple list of lines containing a MIME type and pattern, separated by a colon. It is
deprecated in favour of the globs2 file which also lists the weight of the glob rule.
The lines are ordered by glob weight.
For example:
			<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;# This file was automatically generated by the
# update-mime-database command. DO NOT EDIT!
...
text/x-diff:*.patch
text/x-diff:*.diff
...
</PRE
>
		</P
><P
>&#13;Applications MUST match globs case-insensitively, except when the case-sensitive attribute
is set to true.
This is so that e.g. <TT
CLASS="filename"
>main.C</TT
> will be seen as a C++ file,
but <TT
CLASS="filename"
>IMAGE.GIF</TT
> will still use the *.gif pattern.
		</P
><P
>&#13;If several patterns of the same weight match then the longest pattern SHOULD be used.
In particular, files with multiple extensions (such as
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>Data.tar.gz</TT
>) MUST match the longest sequence of extensions
(eg '*.tar.gz' in preference to '*.gz'). Literal patterns (eg, 'Makefile') must
be matched before all others. It is suggested that patterns beginning with `*.'
and containing no other special characters (`*?[') should be placed in a hash
table for efficient lookup, since this covers the majority of the patterns. Thus,
patterns of this form should be matched before other wildcarded patterns.
		</P
><P
>&#13;If a matching pattern is provided by two or more MIME types, applications
SHOULD not rely on one of them. They are instead supposed to use magic data
(see below) to detect the actual MIME type. This is for instance required to
deal with container formats like Ogg or AVI, that map various video and/or
audio-encoded data to one extension.
		</P
><P
>&#13;There may be several rules mapping to the same type. They should all be merged.
If the same pattern is defined twice, then they MUST be ordered by the
directory the rule came from, as described above.
		</P
><P
>&#13;The <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>glob-deleteall</KBD
> element, which means that implementations
SHOULD discard information from previous directories, is written out into the globs2 file using
__NOGLOBS__ as the pattern. For instance:
			<PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;0:text/x-diff:__NOGLOBS__
50:text/x-diff:*.diff
...
</PRE
>
		</P
><P
>&#13;In the above example, the mimetype text/x-diff is redefined (for instance in a user's
~/.local/share/mime) to only be associated with the pattern *.diff, so the other patterns
like *.patch were removed. The weight in front of the __NOGLOBS__ line is ignored.
In a given globs2 file, the __NOGLOBS__ line for a given mimetype is always written
out before any other globs for this mimetype.
		</P
><P
>&#13;Lines beginning with `#' are comments and should be ignored. Everything from
the `:' character to the newline is part of the pattern; spaces should not be
stripped. The file is in the UTF-8 encoding. The format of the glob pattern
is as for fnmatch(3). The format does not allow a pattern to contain a literal
newline character, but this is not expected to be a problem.
		</P
><P
>&#13;Common types (such as MS Word Documents) will be provided in the X Desktop
Group's package, which MUST be required by all applications using this
specification. Since each application will then only be providing information
about its own types, conflicts should be rare.
		</P
><P
>&#13;The fourth field ("cs" in the first globs2 example) contains a list of comma-separated flags.
The flags currently defined are: cs (for case-sensitive). Implementations should ignore
unknown flags.
		</P
><P
>&#13;Implementations should also ignore further fields, so that the syntax of the globs2 file
can be extended in the future. Example: "50:text/x-c++src:*.C:cs,newflag:newfeature:somethingelse"
should currently be parsed as "50:text/x-c++src:*.C:cs".

is sorted by mimetype.

>&#13;An implementation MAY also get a file's MIME type from the
<KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>user.mime_type</KBD

preference to any guessed type, since the user is able to set it explicitly.
Applications MAY choose to set the type when saving files. Since many
applications and filesystems do not support extended attributes,
implementations MUST NOT rely on this method being available.

>&#13;A type is a subclass of another type if any instance of the first type is
also an instance of the second. For example, all image/svg+xml files are also
application/xml, text/plain and application/octet-stream files. Subclassing is about
the format, rather than the category of the data (for example, there is no
'generic spreadsheet' class that all spreadsheets inherit from).
