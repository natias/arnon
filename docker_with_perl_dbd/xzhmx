Patch 6.2.482
Problem:    Repeating insert of CTRL-K 1 S doesn't work.  The superscript 1 is
	    considered to be a digit. (Juergen Kraemer)
Solution:   In vim_isdigit() only accept '0' to '9'.  Use VIM_ISDIGIT() for
	    speed where possible.  Also add vim_isxdigit().

Files:	    src/mbyte.c, src/misc2.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro

Patch 6.2.492
Problem:    When using ":redraw" while there is a message, the next ":echo"
	    still causes text to scroll. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Reset msg_didout and msg_col, so that after ":redraw" the next
	    message overwrites an existing one.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.493
Problem:    "@x" doesn't work when 'insertmode' is set. (Benji Fisher)

Patch 6.2.496
Problem:    FreeBSD 4.x: When compiled with the pthread library (Python) a
	    complicated pattern may cause Vim to crash.  Catching the signal
	    doesn't work.
Solution:   When compiled with threads, instead of using the normal stacksize
	    limit, use the size of the initial stack.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/config.h.in, src/configure.in,
	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.497 (extra)

Patch 6.2.503
Problem:    Mac: Can't compile MacRoman conversions without the GUI.
Solution:   Also link with the Carbon framework for the terminal version, for
	    the MacRoman conversion functions. (Eckehard Berns)
	    Remove -ltermcap from the GUI link command, it is not needed.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/Makefile, src/configure.in

Patch 6.2.504

Solution:   Add the patch that was missing in 6.2.419.
Files:	    runtime/doc/starting.txt

Patch 6.2.506 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When 'encoding' is a codepage then reading a utf-8 file
	    only works when iconv is available.  Writing a file in another
	    codepage uses the wrong kind of conversion.
Solution:   Use internal conversion functions.  Enable reading and writing
	    files with 'fileencoding' different from 'encoding' for all valid
	    codepages and utf-8 without the need for iconv.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak, src/testdir/test52.in,
	    src/testdir/test52.ok

Patch 6.2.507
Problem:    The ownership of the file with the password for the NetBeans
	    connection is not checked.  "-nb={file}" doesn't work for GTK.

	    others.  Detect "-nb=" for GTK.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.508
Problem:    Win32: "v:lang" does not show the current language for messages if

Problem:    Warning for pointer conversion.
Solution:   Add a type cast.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.511
Problem:    Tags in Russian help files are in utf-8 encoding, which may be
	    different from 'encoding'.
Solution:   Use the "TAG_FILE_ENCODING" field in the tags file to specify the
	    encoding of the tags.  Convert help tags from 'encoding' to the
	    tag file encoding when searching for matches, do the reverse when
	    listing help tags.
Files:	    runtime/doc/tagsrch.txt, src/ex_cmds.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.512
Problem:    Translating "\"\n" is useless. (Gerfried Fuchs)

Files:	    src/main.c, src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.513 (after 6.2.507)
Problem:    NetBeans: the check for owning the connection info file can be
	    simplified. (Nikolay Molchanov)
Solution:   Only check if the access mode is right.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.514
Problem:    When a highlight/syntax group name contains invalid characters
	    there is no warning.
Solution:   Add an error for unprintable characters and a warning for other
	    invalid characters.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.515
Problem:    When using the options window 'swapfile' is reset.
Solution:   Use ":setlocal" instead of ":set".
Files:	    runtime/optwin.vim

Patch 6.2.516
Problem:    The sign column cannot be seen, looks like there are two spaces
	    before the text. (Rob Retter)
Solution:   Add the SignColumn highlight group.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, runtime/doc/sign.txt, src/option.c,
	    src/screen.c, src/syntax.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.517
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multibyte characters replaces
	    too many characters.  In Visual Block mode replacing with a
	    multibyte character doesn't work.
Solution:   Adjust the operator end for the difference in byte length of the
	    original and the replaced character.  Insert all bytes of a
	    multibyte character, take care of double-wide characters.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.518
Problem:    Last line of a window is not updated after using "J" and then "D".
	    (Adri Verhoef)
Solution:   When no line is found below a change that doesn't need updating,
	    update all lines below the change.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.519
Problem:    Mac: cannot read/write files in MacRoman format.
Solution:   Do internal conversion from/to MacRoman to/from utf-8 and latin1.
	    (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.520 (extra)
Problem:    The NSIS installer is outdated.
Solution:   Make it work with NSIS 2.0.  Also include console executables for
	    Win 95/98/ME and Win NT/2000/XP.  Use LZWA compression.  Use
	    "/oname" to avoid having to rename files before running NSIS.
Files:	    Makefile, nsis/gvim.nsi

Patch 6.2.521
Problem:    When using silent Ex mode the "changing a readonly file" warning
	    is omitted but the one second wait isn't. (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   Skip the delay when "silent_mode" is set.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.522
Problem:    GUI: when changing 'cmdheight' in the gvimrc file the window
	    layout is messed up. (Keith Dart)
Solution:   Skip updating the window layout when changing 'cmdheight' while
	    still starting up.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.523
Problem:    When loading a session and aborting when a swap file already
	    exists, the user is left with useless windows. (Robert Webb)
Solution:   Load one file before creating the windows.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.524 (extra, after 6.2.520)
Problem:    Win32: (un)installing gvimext.dll may fail if it was used.
	    The desktop and start menu links are created for the current user
	    instead of all users.
	    Using the home directory as working directory for the links is a
	    bad idea for multi-user systems.
	    Cannot use Vim from the "Open With..." menu.
Solution:   Force a reboot if necessary. (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)  Also use
	    macros for the directory of the source and runtime files.  Use
	    "CSIDL_COMMON_*" instead of "CSIDL_*" when possible.
	    Do not specify a working directory in the links.
	    Add Vim to the "Open With..." menu. (Giuseppe Bilotta)
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c, src/dosinst.h, src/uninstal.c

Patch 6.2.525
Problem:    When the history contains a very long line ":history" causes a

Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.2.526
Problem:    When s:lang is "ja" the Japanese menus are not used.
Solution:   Add 'encoding' to the language when there is no charset.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.2.527
Problem:    The 2html script uses ":wincmd p", which breaks when using some
	    autocommands.
Solution:   Remember the window numbers and jump to them with ":wincmd w".
	    Also add XHTML support. (Panagiotis Issaris)
Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 6.2.528
Problem:    NetBeans: Changes of the "~" command are not reported.
Solution:   Call netbeans_inserted() after performing "~". (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also change NetBeans debugging to append to the log file.
	    Also fix that "~" in Visual block mode changes too much if there
	    are multibyte characters.
Files:	    src/nbdebug.c, src/normal.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.529 (extra)
Problem:    VisVim only works for Admin.  Doing it for one user doesn't work.
	    (Alexandre Gouraud)
Solution:   When registering the module fails, simply continue.
Files:	    src/VisVim/VisVim.cpp

Patch 6.2.530
Problem:    Warning for missing prototype on the Amiga.
Solution:   Include time.h
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.2.531
Problem:    In silent ex mode no messages are given, which makes debugging
	    very difficult.
Solution:   Do output messages when 'verbose' is set.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.532 (extra)
Problem:    Compiling for Win32s with VC 4.1 doesn't work.
Solution:   Don't use CP_UTF8 if it's not defined.  Don't use CSIDL_COMMON*
	    when not defined.
Files:	    src/dosinst.h, src/fileio.c

Win32 console: After patch 6.2.398 Ex mode did not work. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Patch 6.3a.001
Problem:    Win32: if testing for the "--binary" option fails, diff isn't used
	    at all.
Solution:   Handle the "ok" flag properly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.3a.002
Problem:    NetBeans: An insert command from NetBeans beyond the end of a
	    buffer crashes Vim. (Xavier de Gaye)
Solution:   Use a local pos_T structure for the position.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.3a.003
Problem:    E315 error with auto-formatting comments. (Henry Van Roessel)
Solution:   Pass the line number to same_leader().
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.3a.004
Problem:    Test32 fails on Windows XP for the DJGPP version.  Renaming
	    test11.out fails.
Solution:   Don't try renaming, create new files to use for the test.
Files:	    src/testdir/test32.in, src/testdir/test32.ok

Patch 6.3a.005
Problem:    ":checkpath!" does not use 'includeexpr'.
Solution:   Use a file name that was found directly.  When a file was not
	    found and the located name is empty, use the rest of the line.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.006
Problem:    "yip" moves the cursor to the first yanked line, but not to the
	    first column.  Looks like not all text was yanked. (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the first column.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.3a.007
Problem:    'cindent' recognizes "enum" but not "typedef enum".
Solution:   Skip over "typedef" before checking for "enum". (Helmut Stiegler)
	    Also avoid that searching for this item goes too far back.
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/testdir/test3.in, src/testdir/test3.ok

Patch 6.3a.008 (extra)
Problem:    Windows 98: Some of the wide functions are not implemented,
	    resulting in file I/O to fail.  This depends on what Unicode
	    support is installed.
Solution:   Handle the failure and fall back to non-wide functions.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.3a.009
Problem:    Win32: Completion of filenames does not work properly when
	    'encoding' differs from the active code page.
Solution:   Use wide functions for expanding wildcards when appropriate.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.3a.010 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the window title that do not appear in the
	    active codepage are replaced by a question mark.
Solution:   Use DefWindowProcW() instead of DefWindowProc() when possible.
Files:	    src/glbl_ime.cpp, src/globals.h, src/proto/gui_w16.pro,
	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro, src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.011
Problem:    Using the explorer plugin changes a local directory to the global
	    directory.
Solution:   Don't use ":chdir" to restore the current directory.  Make
	    "expand('%:p')" remove "/../" and "/./" items from the path.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/explorer.vim, src/eval.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.012 (extra)
Problem:    On Windows 98 the installer doesn't work, don't even get the "I
	    agree" button.  The check for the path ending in "vim" makes the
	    browse dialog hard to use.  The default path when no previous Vim
	    is installed is "c:\vim" instead of "c:\Program Files\Vim".
Solution:   Remove the background gradient command.  Change the
	    .onVerifyInstDir function to a leave function for the directory
	    page.  Don't let the install program default to c:\vim when no
	    path could be found.
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.3a.013 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Characters in the menu that are not in the active codepage
	    are garbled.
Solution:   Convert menu strings from 'encoding' to the active codepage.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.014
Problem:    Using multibyte text and highlighting in a statusline causes gaps
	    to appear. (Helmut Stiegler)
Solution:   Advance the column by text width instead of number of bytes.  Add
	    the vim_strnsize() function.
Files:	    src/charset.c, src/proto/charset.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3a.015
Problem:    Using the "select all" menu item when 'insertmode' is set and
	    clicking the mouse button doesn't return to Insert mode.  The
	    Buffers/Delete menu doesn't offer a choice to abandon a changed
	    buffer.  (Jens Paulus)
Solution:   Don't use CTRL-\ CTRL-N.  Add ":confirm" for the Buffers menu
	    items.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.3a.016
Problem:    After cancelling the ":confirm" dialog the error message and
	    hit-enter prompt may not be displayed properly.
Solution:   Flush output after showing the dialog.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.3a.017
Problem:    servername() doesn't work when Vim was started with the "-X"
	    argument or when the "exclude" in 'clipboard' matches the terminal
	    name.  (Robert Nowotniak)
Solution:   Force connecting to the X server when using client-server
	    commands.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/globals.h, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.3a.018 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Compiler warning for return value of make_connection().
Solution:   Use void return type.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.019 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: typing non-latin1 characters doesn't work.
Solution:   Invoke _OnChar() directly to avoid that the argument is truncated
	    to a byte.  Convert the UTF-16 character to bytes according to
	    'encoding' and ignore 'termencoding'.  Same for _OnSysChar().
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.3a.020 (extra)
Problem:    Missing support for AROS (AmigaOS reimplementation).  Amiga GUI
	    doesn't work.
Solution:   Add AROS support.  (Adam Chodorowski)
	    Fix Amiga GUI problems. (Georg Steger, Ali Akcaagac)
Files:	    Makefile, src/Make_aros.mak, src/gui_amiga.c, src/gui_amiga.h,
	    src/memfile.c, src/os_amiga.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.3a.021 (after 6.3a.017)
Problem:    Can't compile with X11 but without GUI.
Solution:   Put use of "gui.in_use" inside an #ifdef.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.3a.022
Problem:    When typing Tabs when 'softtabstop' is used and 'list' is set a
	    tab is counted for two spaces.
Solution:   Use the "L" flag in 'cpoptions' to tell whether a tab is counted
	    as two spaces or as 'tabstop'. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/edit.c

Patch 6.3a.023
Problem:    Completion on the command line doesn't handle backslashes
	    properly.  Only the tail of matches is shown, even when not
	    completing filenames.
Solution:   When turning the string into a pattern double backslashes.  Don't
	    omit the path when not expanding files or directories.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 6.3a.024
Problem:    The "save all" toolbar item fails for buffers that don't have a
	    name.  When using ":wa" or closing the Vim window and there are
	    nameless buffers, browsing for a name may cause the name being
	    given to the wrong buffer or not stored properly.  ":browse" only
	    worked for one file.
Solution:   Use ":confirm browse" for "save all".
	    Pass buffer argument to setfname().  Restore "browse" flag and
	    "forceit" after doing the work for one file.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_cmds2.c,

Fixed							*fixed-6.4*
-----

"dFxd;" deleted the character under the cursor, "d;" didn't remember the
exclusiveness of the motion.

When using "set laststatus=2 cmdheight=2" in the .gvimrc you may only get one
line for the cmdline. (Christian Robinson)  Invoke command_height() after the
GUI has started up.

Gcc would warn "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict -aliasing
rules".  Avoid using typecasts for variable pointers.

Gcc 3.x interprets the -MM argument differently.  Change "-I /path" to
"-isystem /path" for "make depend".


Patch 6.3.001
Problem:    ":browse split" gives the file selection dialog twice. (Gordon
	    Bazeley)  Same problem for ":browse diffpatch".

Patch 6.3.002
Problem:    When using translated help files with non-ASCII latin1 characters
	    in the first line the utf-8 detection is wrong.
Solution:   Properly detect utf-8 characters.  When a mix of encodings is
	    detected continue with the next language and avoid a "no matches"
	    error because of "got_int" being set.  Add the directory name to
	    the error message for a duplicate tag.

	    around the end of the buffer.  Don't give that message again when
	    the string was not found.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/search.c

Patch 6.3.005
Problem:    Crash when searching for a pattern with a character offset and
	    starting in a closed fold. (Frank Butler)

	    (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.3.022 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the last character of a file name is a multibyte
	    character and the last byte is a path separator, the file cannot
	    be written.  A trail byte that is a space makes that a file cannot
	    be opened from the command line.
Solution:   Recognize double-byte characters when parsing the command line.
	    In mch_stat() check for the last byte to be part of a multibyte
	    character.  (Taro Muraoka)

	    abbreviations for the same characters is not possible.  For
	    example, when <Space> is mapped to something that starts with a
	    space, typing <Space> does not expand abbreviations.
Solution:   Only disable expanding abbreviations when a mapping is not
	    remapped, don't disable it when the RHS of a mapping starts with

	    serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/gui.c, src/if_xcmdsrv.c, src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.025 (extra)
Problem:    Missing NUL for list of server names.
Solution:   Add ga_append(NUL) in serverGetVimNames().
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.3.026
Problem:    When ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim contains a command that
	    reloads the colors an endless loop and/or a crash may occur.
Solution:   Only free the old value of an option when it was originally
	    allocated.  Limit recursiveness of init_highlight() to 5 levels.
Files:	    src/option.c, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.027
Problem:    VMS: Writing a file may insert extra CR characters.  Not all
	    terminals are recognized correctly.  Vt320 doesn't support colors.

	    change was made, current_col may be past the end of the line.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.3.030
Problem:    GTK 2: Crash when sourcing a script that deletes the menus, sets
	    'encoding' to "utf-8" and loads the menus again.  GTK error
	    message when tooltip text is in a wrong encoding.
Solution:   Don't copy characters from the old screen to the new screen when
	    switching 'encoding' to utf-8, they may be invalid.  Only set the
	    tooltip when it is valid utf-8.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/mbyte.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c

Patch 6.3.031
