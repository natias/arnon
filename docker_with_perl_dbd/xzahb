By default, classes are constructed using "type()". The class body is
executed in a new namespace and the class name is bound locally to the
result of "type(name, bases, namespace)".

The class creation process can be customized by passing the
"metaclass" keyword argument in the class definition line, or by
inheriting from an existing class that included such an argument. In
the following example, both "MyClass" and "MySubclass" are instances
of "Meta":

   class Meta(type):
       pass

   class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
       pass

   class MySubclass(MyClass):
       pass

Any other keyword arguments that are specified in the class definition
are passed through to all metaclass operations described below.

When a class definition is executed, the following steps occur:

* MRO entries are resolved;

* the appropriate metaclass is determined;

* the class namespace is prepared;

* the class body is executed;

* the class object is created.


Resolving MRO entries
---------------------

If a base that appears in class definition is not an instance of
"type", then an "__mro_entries__" method is searched on it. If found,
it is called with the original bases tuple. This method must return a
tuple of classes that will be used instead of this base. The tuple may
be empty, in such case the original base is ignored.

See also:

  **PEP 560** - Core support for typing module and generic types


Determining the appropriate metaclass
-------------------------------------

The appropriate metaclass for a class definition is determined as
follows:

* if no bases and no explicit metaclass are given, then "type()" is
  used;

* if an explicit metaclass is given and it is *not* an instance of
  "type()", then it is used directly as the metaclass;

* if an instance of "type()" is given as the explicit metaclass, or
  bases are defined, then the most derived metaclass is used.

The most derived metaclass is selected from the explicitly specified
metaclass (if any) and the metaclasses (i.e. "type(cls)") of all
specified base classes. The most derived metaclass is one which is a
subtype of *all* of these candidate metaclasses. If none of the
candidate metaclasses meets that criterion, then the class definition
will fail with "TypeError".


Preparing the class namespace
-----------------------------

Once the appropriate metaclass has been identified, then the class
namespace is prepared. If the metaclass has a "__prepare__" attribute,
it is called as "namespace = metaclass.__prepare__(name, bases,
**kwds)" (where the additional keyword arguments, if any, come from
the class definition). The "__prepare__" method should be implemented
as a "classmethod". The namespace returned by "__prepare__" is passed
in to "__new__", but when the final class object is created the
namespace is copied into a new "dict".

If the metaclass has no "__prepare__" attribute, then the class
namespace is initialised as an empty ordered mapping.

See also:

  **PEP 3115** - Metaclasses in Python 3000
     Introduced the "__prepare__" namespace hook


Executing the class body
------------------------

The class body is executed (approximately) as "exec(body, globals(),
namespace)". The key difference from a normal call to "exec()" is that
lexical scoping allows the class body (including any methods) to
reference names from the current and outer scopes when the class
definition occurs inside a function.

However, even when the class definition occurs inside the function,
methods defined inside the class still cannot see names defined at the
class scope. Class variables must be accessed through the first
parameter of instance or class methods, or through the implicit
lexically scoped "__class__" reference described in the next section.


Creating the class object
-------------------------

Once the class namespace has been populated by executing the class
body, the class object is created by calling "metaclass(name, bases,
namespace, **kwds)" (the additional keywords passed here are the same
as those passed to "__prepare__").

This class object is the one that will be referenced by the zero-
argument form of "super()". "__class__" is an implicit closure
reference created by the compiler if any methods in a class body refer
to either "__class__" or "super". This allows the zero argument form
of "super()" to correctly identify the class being defined based on
lexical scoping, while the class or instance that was used to make the
current call is identified based on the first argument passed to the
method.

**CPython implementation detail:** In CPython 3.6 and later, the
"__class__" cell is passed to the metaclass as a "__classcell__" entry
in the class namespace. If present, this must be propagated up to the
"type.__new__" call in order for the class to be initialised
correctly. Failing to do so will result in a "RuntimeError" in Python
3.8.

When using the default metaclass "type", or any metaclass that
ultimately calls "type.__new__", the following additional
customization steps are invoked after creating the class object:

1. The "type.__new__" method collects all of the attributes in the
   class namespace that define a "__set_name__()" method;

2. Those "__set_name__" methods are called with the class being
   defined and the assigned name of that particular attribute;

3. The "__init_subclass__()" hook is called on the immediate parent of
   the new class in its method resolution order.

After the class object is created, it is passed to the class
decorators included in the class definition (if any) and the resulting
object is bound in the local namespace as the defined class.

When a new class is created by "type.__new__", the object provided as
the namespace parameter is copied to a new ordered mapping and the
original object is discarded. The new copy is wrapped in a read-only
proxy, which becomes the "__dict__" attribute of the class object.

See also:

  **PEP 3135** - New super
     Describes the implicit "__class__" closure reference


Uses for metaclasses
--------------------

The potential uses for metaclasses are boundless. Some ideas that have
been explored include enum, logging, interface checking, automatic
delegation, automatic property creation, proxies, frameworks, and
automatic resource locking/synchronization.


Customizing instance and subclass checks
========================================

The following methods are used to override the default behavior of the
"isinstance()" and "issubclass()" built-in functions.

In particular, the metaclass "abc.ABCMeta" implements these methods in
order to allow the addition of Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) as
‚Äúvirtual base classes‚Äù to any class or type (including built-in
types), including other ABCs.

class.__instancecheck__(self, instance)

   Return true if *instance* should be considered a (direct or
   indirect) instance of *class*. If defined, called to implement
   "isinstance(instance, class)".

class.__subclasscheck__(self, subclass)

   Return true if *subclass* should be considered a (direct or
   indirect) subclass of *class*.  If defined, called to implement
   "issubclass(subclass, class)".

Note that these methods are looked up on the type (metaclass) of a
class.  They cannot be defined as class methods in the actual class.
This is consistent with the lookup of special methods that are called
on instances, only in this case the instance is itself a class.

See also:

  **PEP 3119** - Introducing Abstract Base Classes
     Includes the specification for customizing "isinstance()" and
     "issubclass()" behavior through "__instancecheck__()" and
     "__subclasscheck__()", with motivation for this functionality in
     the context of adding Abstract Base Classes (see the "abc"
     module) to the language.


Emulating generic types
=======================

When using *type annotations*, it is often useful to *parameterize* a
*generic type* using Python‚Äôs square-brackets notation. For example,
the annotation "list[int]" might be used to signify a "list" in which
all the elements are of type "int".

See also:

  **PEP 484** - Type Hints
     Introducing Python‚Äôs framework for type annotations

  Generic Alias Types
     Documentation for objects representing parameterized generic
     classes

  Generics, user-defined generics and "typing.Generic"
     Documentation on how to implement generic classes that can be
     parameterized at runtime and understood by static type-checkers.

A class can *generally* only be parameterized if it defines the
special class method "__class_getitem__()".

classmethod object.__class_getitem__(cls, key)

   Return an object representing the specialization of a generic class
   by type arguments found in *key*.

   When defined on a class, "__class_getitem__()" is automatically a
   class method. As such, there is no need for it to be decorated with
   "@classmethod" when it is defined.


The purpose of *__class_getitem__*
----------------------------------

The purpose of "__class_getitem__()" is to allow runtime
parameterization of standard-library generic classes in order to more
easily apply *type hints* to these classes.

To implement custom generic classes that can be parameterized at
runtime and understood by static type-checkers, users should either
inherit from a standard library class that already implements
"__class_getitem__()", or inherit from "typing.Generic", which has its
own implementation of "__class_getitem__()".

Custom implementations of "__class_getitem__()" on classes defined
outside of the standard library may not be understood by third-party
type-checkers such as mypy. Using "__class_getitem__()" on any class
for purposes other than type hinting is discouraged.


*__class_getitem__* versus *__getitem__*
----------------------------------------

Usually, the subscription of an object using square brackets will call
the "__getitem__()" instance method defined on the object‚Äôs class.
However, if the object being subscribed is itself a class, the class
method "__class_getitem__()" may be called instead.
"__class_getitem__()" should return a GenericAlias object if it is
properly defined.

Presented with the *expression* "obj[x]", the Python interpreter
follows something like the following process to decide whether
"__getitem__()" or "__class_getitem__()" should be called:

   from inspect import isclass

   def subscribe(obj, x):
       """Return the result of the expression 'obj[x]'"""

       class_of_obj = type(obj)

       # If the class of obj defines __getitem__,
       # call class_of_obj.__getitem__(obj, x)
       if hasattr(class_of_obj, '__getitem__'):
           return class_of_obj.__getitem__(obj, x)

       # Else, if obj is a class and defines __class_getitem__,
       # call obj.__class_getitem__(x)
       elif isclass(obj) and hasattr(obj, '__class_getitem__'):
           return obj.__class_getitem__(x)

       # Else, raise an exception
       else:
           raise TypeError(
               f"'{class_of_obj.__name__}' object is not subscriptable"
           )

In Python, all classes are themselves instances of other classes. The
class of a class is known as that class‚Äôs *metaclass*, and most
classes have the "type" class as their metaclass. "type" does not
define "__getitem__()", meaning that expressions such as "list[int]",
"dict[str, float]" and "tuple[str, bytes]" all result in
"__class_getitem__()" being called:

   >>> # list has class "type" as its metaclass, like most classes:
   >>> type(list)
   <class 'type'>
   >>> type(dict) == type(list) == type(tuple) == type(str) == type(bytes)
   True
   >>> # "list[int]" calls "list.__class_getitem__(int)"
   >>> list[int]
   list[int]
   >>> # list.__class_getitem__ returns a GenericAlias object:
   >>> type(list[int])
   <class 'types.GenericAlias'>

However, if a class has a custom metaclass that defines
"__getitem__()", subscribing the class may result in different
behaviour. An example of this can be found in the "enum" module:

   >>> from enum import Enum
   >>> class Menu(Enum):
   ...     """A breakfast menu"""
   ...     SPAM = 'spam'
   ...     BACON = 'bacon'
   ...
   >>> # Enum classes have a custom metaclass:
   >>> type(Menu)
   <class 'enum.EnumMeta'>
   >>> # EnumMeta defines __getitem__,
   >>> # so __class_getitem__ is not called,
   >>> # and the result is not a GenericAlias object:
   >>> Menu['SPAM']
   <Menu.SPAM: 'spam'>
   >>> type(Menu['SPAM'])
   <enum 'Menu'>

See also:

  **PEP 560** - Core Support for typing module and generic types
     Introducing "__class_getitem__()", and outlining when a
     subscription results in "__class_getitem__()" being called
     instead of "__getitem__()"


Emulating callable objects
==========================

object.__call__(self[, args...])

   Called when the instance is ‚Äúcalled‚Äù as a function; if this method
   is defined, "x(arg1, arg2, ...)" roughly translates to
   "type(x).__call__(x, arg1, ...)".


Emulating container types
=========================

The following methods can be defined to implement container objects.
Containers usually are *sequences* (such as "lists" or "tuples") or
*mappings* (like "dictionaries"), but can represent other containers
as well.  The first set of methods is used either to emulate a
sequence or to emulate a mapping; the difference is that for a
sequence, the allowable keys should be the integers *k* for which "0
<= k < N" where *N* is the length of the sequence, or "slice" objects,
which define a range of items.  It is also recommended that mappings
provide the methods "keys()", "values()", "items()", "get()",
"clear()", "setdefault()", "pop()", "popitem()", "copy()", and
"update()" behaving similar to those for Python‚Äôs standard
"dictionary" objects.  The "collections.abc" module provides a
"MutableMapping" *abstract base class* to help create those methods
from a base set of "__getitem__()", "__setitem__()", "__delitem__()",
and "keys()". Mutable sequences should provide methods "append()",
"count()", "index()", "extend()", "insert()", "pop()", "remove()",
"reverse()" and "sort()", like Python standard "list" objects.
Finally, sequence types should implement addition (meaning
concatenation) and multiplication (meaning repetition) by defining the
methods "__add__()", "__radd__()", "__iadd__()", "__mul__()",
"__rmul__()" and "__imul__()" described below; they should not define
other numerical operators.  It is recommended that both mappings and
sequences implement the "__contains__()" method to allow efficient use
of the "in" operator; for mappings, "in" should search the mapping‚Äôs
keys; for sequences, it should search through the values.  It is
further recommended that both mappings and sequences implement the
"__iter__()" method to allow efficient iteration through the
container; for mappings, "__iter__()" should iterate through the
object‚Äôs keys; for sequences, it should iterate through the values.

object.__len__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in function "len()".  Should return
   the length of the object, an integer ">=" 0.  Also, an object that
   doesn‚Äôt define a "__bool__()" method and whose "__len__()" method
   returns zero is considered to be false in a Boolean context.

   **CPython implementation detail:** In CPython, the length is
   required to be at most "sys.maxsize". If the length is larger than
   "sys.maxsize" some features (such as "len()") may raise
   "OverflowError".  To prevent raising "OverflowError" by truth value
   testing, an object must define a "__bool__()" method.

object.__length_hint__(self)

   Called to implement "operator.length_hint()". Should return an
   estimated length for the object (which may be greater or less than
   the actual length). The length must be an integer ">=" 0. The
   return value may also be "NotImplemented", which is treated the
   same as if the "__length_hint__" method didn‚Äôt exist at all. This
   method is purely an optimization and is never required for
   correctness.

   New in version 3.4.

Note:

  Slicing is done exclusively with the following three methods.  A
  call like

     a[1:2] = b

  is translated to

     a[slice(1, 2, None)] = b

  and so forth.  Missing slice items are always filled in with "None".

object.__getitem__(self, key)

   Called to implement evaluation of "self[key]". For *sequence*
   types, the accepted keys should be integers and slice objects.
   Note that the special interpretation of negative indexes (if the
   class wishes to emulate a *sequence* type) is up to the
   "__getitem__()" method. If *key* is of an inappropriate type,
   "TypeError" may be raised; if of a value outside the set of indexes
   for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative
   values), "IndexError" should be raised. For *mapping* types, if
   *key* is missing (not in the container), "KeyError" should be
   raised.

   Note:

     "for" loops expect that an "IndexError" will be raised for
     illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the
     sequence.

   Note:

     When subscripting a *class*, the special class method
     "__class_getitem__()" may be called instead of "__getitem__()".
     See __class_getitem__ versus __getitem__ for more details.

object.__setitem__(self, key, value)

   Called to implement assignment to "self[key]".  Same note as for
   "__getitem__()".  This should only be implemented for mappings if
   the objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys
   can be added, or for sequences if elements can be replaced.  The
   same exceptions should be raised for improper *key* values as for
   the "__getitem__()" method.

object.__delitem__(self, key)

   Called to implement deletion of "self[key]".  Same note as for
   "__getitem__()".  This should only be implemented for mappings if
   the objects support removal of keys, or for sequences if elements
   can be removed from the sequence.  The same exceptions should be
   raised for improper *key* values as for the "__getitem__()" method.

object.__missing__(self, key)

   Called by "dict"."__getitem__()" to implement "self[key]" for dict
   subclasses when key is not in the dictionary.

object.__iter__(self)

   This method is called when an *iterator* is required for a
   container. This method should return a new iterator object that can
   iterate over all the objects in the container.  For mappings, it
   should iterate over the keys of the container.

object.__reversed__(self)

   Called (if present) by the "reversed()" built-in to implement
   reverse iteration.  It should return a new iterator object that
   iterates over all the objects in the container in reverse order.

   If the "__reversed__()" method is not provided, the "reversed()"
   built-in will fall back to using the sequence protocol ("__len__()"
   and "__getitem__()").  Objects that support the sequence protocol
   should only provide "__reversed__()" if they can provide an
   implementation that is more efficient than the one provided by
   "reversed()".

The membership test operators ("in" and "not in") are normally
implemented as an iteration through a container. However, container
objects can supply the following special method with a more efficient
implementation, which also does not require the object be iterable.

object.__contains__(self, item)

   Called to implement membership test operators.  Should return true
   if *item* is in *self*, false otherwise.  For mapping objects, this
   should consider the keys of the mapping rather than the values or
   the key-item pairs.

   For objects that don‚Äôt define "__contains__()", the membership test
   first tries iteration via "__iter__()", then the old sequence
   iteration protocol via "__getitem__()", see this section in the
   language reference.


Emulating numeric types
=======================

The following methods can be defined to emulate numeric objects.
Methods corresponding to operations that are not supported by the
particular kind of number implemented (e.g., bitwise operations for
non-integral numbers) should be left undefined.

object.__add__(self, other)
object.__sub__(self, other)
object.__mul__(self, other)
object.__matmul__(self, other)
object.__truediv__(self, other)
object.__floordiv__(self, other)
object.__mod__(self, other)
object.__divmod__(self, other)
object.__pow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__lshift__(self, other)
object.__rshift__(self, other)
object.__and__(self, other)
object.__xor__(self, other)
object.__or__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic
   operations ("+", "-", "*", "@", "/", "//", "%", "divmod()",
   "pow()", "**", "<<", ">>", "&", "^", "|").  For instance, to
   evaluate the expression "x + y", where *x* is an instance of a
   class that has an "__add__()" method, "type(x).__add__(x, y)" is
   called.  The "__divmod__()" method should be the equivalent to
   using "__floordiv__()" and "__mod__()"; it should not be related to
   "__truediv__()".  Note that "__pow__()" should be defined to accept
   an optional third argument if the ternary version of the built-in
   "pow()" function is to be supported.

   If one of those methods does not support the operation with the
   supplied arguments, it should return "NotImplemented".

object.__radd__(self, other)
object.__rsub__(self, other)
object.__rmul__(self, other)
object.__rmatmul__(self, other)
object.__rtruediv__(self, other)
object.__rfloordiv__(self, other)
object.__rmod__(self, other)
object.__rdivmod__(self, other)
object.__rpow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__rlshift__(self, other)
object.__rrshift__(self, other)
object.__rand__(self, other)
object.__rxor__(self, other)
object.__ror__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic
   operations ("+", "-", "*", "@", "/", "//", "%", "divmod()",
   "pow()", "**", "<<", ">>", "&", "^", "|") with reflected (swapped)
   operands.  These functions are only called if the left operand does
   not support the corresponding operation [3] and the operands are of
   different types. [4] For instance, to evaluate the expression "x -
   y", where *y* is an instance of a class that has an "__rsub__()"
   method, "type(y).__rsub__(y, x)" is called if "type(x).__sub__(x,
   y)" returns *NotImplemented*.

   Note that ternary "pow()" will not try calling "__rpow__()" (the
   coercion rules would become too complicated).

   Note:

     If the right operand‚Äôs type is a subclass of the left operand‚Äôs
     type and that subclass provides a different implementation of the
     reflected method for the operation, this method will be called
     before the left operand‚Äôs non-reflected method. This behavior
     allows subclasses to override their ancestors‚Äô operations.

object.__iadd__(self, other)
object.__isub__(self, other)
object.__imul__(self, other)
object.__imatmul__(self, other)
object.__itruediv__(self, other)
object.__ifloordiv__(self, other)
object.__imod__(self, other)
object.__ipow__(self, other[, modulo])
object.__ilshift__(self, other)
object.__irshift__(self, other)
object.__iand__(self, other)
object.__ixor__(self, other)
object.__ior__(self, other)

   These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic
   assignments ("+=", "-=", "*=", "@=", "/=", "//=", "%=", "**=",
   "<<=", ">>=", "&=", "^=", "|=").  These methods should attempt to
   do the operation in-place (modifying *self*) and return the result
   (which could be, but does not have to be, *self*).  If a specific
   method is not defined, the augmented assignment falls back to the
   normal methods.  For instance, if *x* is an instance of a class
   with an "__iadd__()" method, "x += y" is equivalent to "x =
   x.__iadd__(y)" . Otherwise, "x.__add__(y)" and "y.__radd__(x)" are
   considered, as with the evaluation of "x + y". In certain
   situations, augmented assignment can result in unexpected errors
   (see Why does a_tuple[i] += [‚Äòitem‚Äô] raise an exception when the
   addition works?), but this behavior is in fact part of the data
   model.

object.__neg__(self)
object.__pos__(self)
object.__abs__(self)
object.__invert__(self)

   Called to implement the unary arithmetic operations ("-", "+",
   "abs()" and "~").

object.__complex__(self)
object.__int__(self)
object.__float__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in functions "complex()", "int()" and
   "float()".  Should return a value of the appropriate type.

object.__index__(self)

   Called to implement "operator.index()", and whenever Python needs
   to losslessly convert the numeric object to an integer object (such
   as in slicing, or in the built-in "bin()", "hex()" and "oct()"
   functions). Presence of this method indicates that the numeric
   object is an integer type.  Must return an integer.

   If "__int__()", "__float__()" and "__complex__()" are not defined
   then corresponding built-in functions "int()", "float()" and
   "complex()" fall back to "__index__()".

object.__round__(self[, ndigits])
object.__trunc__(self)
object.__floor__(self)
object.__ceil__(self)

   Called to implement the built-in function "round()" and "math"
   functions "trunc()", "floor()" and "ceil()". Unless *ndigits* is
   passed to "__round__()" all these methods should return the value
   of the object truncated to an "Integral" (typically an "int").

   The built-in function "int()" falls back to "__trunc__()" if
   neither "__int__()" nor "__index__()" is defined.

   Changed in version 3.11: The delegation of "int()" to "__trunc__()"
   is deprecated.


With Statement Context Managers
===============================

A *context manager* is an object that defines the runtime context to
be established when executing a "with" statement. The context manager
handles the entry into, and the exit from, the desired runtime context
for the execution of the block of code.  Context managers are normally
invoked using the "with" statement (described in section The with
statement), but can also be used by directly invoking their methods.

Typical uses of context managers include saving and restoring various
kinds of global state, locking and unlocking resources, closing opened
files, etc.

For more information on context managers, see Context Manager Types.

object.__enter__(self)

   Enter the runtime context related to this object. The "with"
   statement will bind this method‚Äôs return value to the target(s)
   specified in the "as" clause of the statement, if any.

object.__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)

   Exit the runtime context related to this object. The parameters
   describe the exception that caused the context to be exited. If the
   context was exited without an exception, all three arguments will
   be "None".

   If an exception is supplied, and the method wishes to suppress the
   exception (i.e., prevent it from being propagated), it should
   return a true value. Otherwise, the exception will be processed
   normally upon exit from this method.

   Note that "__exit__()" methods should not reraise the passed-in
   exception; this is the caller‚Äôs responsibility.

See also:

  **PEP 343** - The ‚Äúwith‚Äù statement
     The specification, background, and examples for the Python "with"
     statement.


Customizing positional arguments in class pattern matching
==========================================================

When using a class name in a pattern, positional arguments in the
pattern are not allowed by default, i.e. "case MyClass(x, y)" is
typically invalid without special support in "MyClass". To be able to
use that kind of pattern, the class needs to define a *__match_args__*
attribute.

object.__match_args__

   This class variable can be assigned a tuple of strings. When this
   class is used in a class pattern with positional arguments, each
   positional argument will be converted into a keyword argument,
   using the corresponding value in *__match_args__* as the keyword.
   The absence of this attribute is equivalent to setting it to "()".

For example, if "MyClass.__match_args__" is "("left", "center",
"right")" that means that "case MyClass(x, y)" is equivalent to "case
MyClass(left=x, center=y)". Note that the number of arguments in the
pattern must be smaller than or equal to the number of elements in
*__match_args__*; if it is larger, the pattern match attempt will
raise a "TypeError".

New in version 3.10.

See also:

  **PEP 634** - Structural Pattern Matching
     The specification for the Python "match" statement.


Special method lookup
=====================

For custom classes, implicit invocations of special methods are only
guaranteed to work correctly if defined on an object‚Äôs type, not in
the object‚Äôs instance dictionary.  That behaviour is the reason why
the following code raises an exception:

   >>> class C:
   ...     pass
   ...
   >>> c = C()
   >>> c.__len__ = lambda: 5
   >>> len(c)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: object of type 'C' has no len()

The rationale behind this behaviour lies with a number of special
methods such as "__hash__()" and "__repr__()" that are implemented by
all objects, including type objects. If the implicit lookup of these
methods used the conventional lookup process, they would fail when
invoked on the type object itself:

   >>> 1 .__hash__() == hash(1)
   True
   >>> int.__hash__() == hash(int)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: descriptor '__hash__' of 'int' object needs an argument

Incorrectly attempting to invoke an unbound method of a class in this
way is sometimes referred to as ‚Äòmetaclass confusion‚Äô, and is avoided
by bypassing the instance when looking up special methods:

   >>> type(1).__hash__(1) == hash(1)
   True
   >>> type(int).__hash__(int) == hash(int)
   True

In addition to bypassing any instance attributes in the interest of
correctness, implicit special method lookup generally also bypasses
the "__getattribute__()" method even of the object‚Äôs metaclass:

   >>> class Meta(type):
   ...     def __getattribute__(*args):
   ...         print("Metaclass getattribute invoked")
   ...         return type.__getattribute__(*args)
   ...
   >>> class C(object, metaclass=Meta):
   ...     def __len__(self):
   ...         return 10
   ...     def __getattribute__(*args):
   ...         print("Class getattribute invoked")
   ...         return object.__getattribute__(*args)
   ...
   >>> c = C()
   >>> c.__len__()                 # Explicit lookup via instance
   Class getattribute invoked
   10
   >>> type(c).__len__(c)          # Explicit lookup via type
   Metaclass getattribute invoked
   10
   >>> len(c)                      # Implicit lookup
   10

Bypassing the "__getattribute__()" machinery in this fashion provides
significant scope for speed optimisations within the interpreter, at
the cost of some flexibility in the handling of special methods (the
special method *must* be set on the class object itself in order to be
consistently invoked by the interpreter).
zstring-methodsu‘`  String Methods
**************

Strings implement all of the common sequence operations, along with
the additional methods described below.

Strings also support two styles of string formatting, one providing a
large degree of flexibility and customization (see "str.format()",
Format String Syntax and Custom String Formatting) and the other based
on C "printf" style formatting that handles a narrower range of types
and is slightly harder to use correctly, but is often faster for the
cases it can handle (printf-style String Formatting).

The Text Processing Services section of the standard library covers a
number of other modules that provide various text related utilities
(including regular expression support in the "re" module).

str.capitalize()

   Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized
   and the rest lowercased.

   Changed in version 3.8: The first character is now put into
   titlecase rather than uppercase. This means that characters like
   digraphs will only have their first letter capitalized, instead of
   the full character.

str.casefold()

   Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be
   used for caseless matching.

   Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because
   it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For
   example, the German lowercase letter "'√ü'" is equivalent to ""ss"".
   Since it is already lowercase, "lower()" would do nothing to "'√ü'";
   "casefold()" converts it to ""ss"".

   The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the
   Unicode Standard.

   New in version 3.3.

str.center(width[, fillchar])

   Return centered in a string of length *width*. Padding is done
   using the specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII space). The
   original string is returned if *width* is less than or equal to
   "len(s)".

str.count(sub[, start[, end]])

   Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring *sub*
   in the range [*start*, *end*].  Optional arguments *start* and
   *end* are interpreted as in slice notation.

   If *sub* is empty, returns the number of empty strings between
   characters which is the length of the string plus one.

str.encode(encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')

   Return the string encoded to "bytes".

   *encoding* defaults to "'utf-8'"; see Standard Encodings for
   possible values.

   *errors* controls how encoding errors are handled. If "'strict'"
   (the default), a "UnicodeError" exception is raised. Other possible
   values are "'ignore'", "'replace'", "'xmlcharrefreplace'",
   "'backslashreplace'" and any other name registered via
   "codecs.register_error()". See Error Handlers for details.

   For performance reasons, the value of *errors* is not checked for
   validity unless an encoding error actually occurs, Python
   Development Mode is enabled or a debug build is used.

   Changed in version 3.1: Added support for keyword arguments.

   Changed in version 3.9: The value of the *errors* argument is now
   checked in Python Development Mode and in debug mode.

str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])

   Return "True" if the string ends with the specified *suffix*,
   otherwise return "False".  *suffix* can also be a tuple of suffixes
   to look for.  With optional *start*, test beginning at that
   position.  With optional *end*, stop comparing at that position.

str.expandtabs(tabsize=8)

   Return a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced
   by one or more spaces, depending on the current column and the
   given tab size.  Tab positions occur every *tabsize* characters
   (default is 8, giving tab positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on).
   To expand the string, the current column is set to zero and the
   string is examined character by character.  If the character is a
   tab ("\t"), one or more space characters are inserted in the result
   until the current column is equal to the next tab position. (The
   tab character itself is not copied.)  If the character is a newline
   ("\n") or return ("\r"), it is copied and the current column is
   reset to zero.  Any other character is copied unchanged and the
   current column is incremented by one regardless of how the
   character is represented when printed.

   >>> '01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs()
   '01      012     0123    01234'
   >>> '01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs(4)
   '01  012 0123    01234'

str.find(sub[, start[, end]])

   Return the lowest index in the string where substring *sub* is
   found within the slice "s[start:end]".  Optional arguments *start*
   and *end* are interpreted as in slice notation.  Return "-1" if
   *sub* is not found.

   Note:

     The "find()" method should be used only if you need to know the
     position of *sub*.  To check if *sub* is a substring or not, use
     the "in" operator:

        >>> 'Py' in 'Python'
        True

str.format(*args, **kwargs)

   Perform a string formatting operation.  The string on which this
   method is called can contain literal text or replacement fields
   delimited by braces "{}".  Each replacement field contains either
   the numeric index of a positional argument, or the name of a
   keyword argument.  Returns a copy of the string where each
   replacement field is replaced with the string value of the
   corresponding argument.

   >>> "The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}".format(1+2)
   'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'

   See Format String Syntax for a description of the various
   formatting options that can be specified in format strings.

   Note:

     When formatting a number ("int", "float", "complex",
     "decimal.Decimal" and subclasses) with the "n" type (ex:
     "'{:n}'.format(1234)"), the function temporarily sets the
     "LC_CTYPE" locale to the "LC_NUMERIC" locale to decode
     "decimal_point" and "thousands_sep" fields of "localeconv()" if
     they are non-ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the "LC_NUMERIC"
     locale is different than the "LC_CTYPE" locale.  This temporary
     change affects other threads.

   Changed in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the "n" type,
   the function sets temporarily the "LC_CTYPE" locale to the
   "LC_NUMERIC" locale in some cases.

str.format_map(mapping)

   Similar to "str.format(**mapping)", except that "mapping" is used
   directly and not copied to a "dict".  This is useful if for example
   "mapping" is a dict subclass:

   >>> class Default(dict):
   ...     def __missing__(self, key):
   ...         return key
   ...
   >>> '{name} was born in {country}'.format_map(Default(name='Guido'))
   'Guido was born in country'

   New in version 3.2.

str.index(sub[, start[, end]])

   Like "find()", but raise "ValueError" when the substring is not
   found.

str.isalnum()

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and
   there is at least one character, "False" otherwise.  A character
   "c" is alphanumeric if one of the following returns "True":
   "c.isalpha()", "c.isdecimal()", "c.isdigit()", or "c.isnumeric()".

str.isalpha()

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are alphabetic and
   there is at least one character, "False" otherwise.  Alphabetic
   characters are those characters defined in the Unicode character
   database as ‚ÄúLetter‚Äù, i.e., those with general category property
   being one of ‚ÄúLm‚Äù, ‚ÄúLt‚Äù, ‚ÄúLu‚Äù, ‚ÄúLl‚Äù, or ‚ÄúLo‚Äù.  Note that this is
   different from the ‚ÄúAlphabetic‚Äù property defined in the Unicode
   Standard.
