documentation that came with that distribution to determine the
correct place to report bugs.

Bug reports should be submitted to the GitHub issue tracker at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. The B<perlbug@perl.org>
address no longer automatically opens tickets. You can use this tool
to compose your report and save it to a file which you can then submit
to the issue tracker.

In extreme cases, B<perlbug> may not work well enough on your system
to guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you
may be able to use B<perlbug -d> or B<perl -V> to get system
configuration information to include in your issue report.


When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:

=over 4

=item What version of Perl you are running?

Type C<perl -v> at the command line to find out.

=item Are you running the latest released version of perl?

Look at L<http://www.perl.org/> to find out.  If you are not using the
latest released version, please try to replicate your bug on the
latest stable release.

Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl, especially
those which indicate you haven't also tested the current stable
release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the
volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in
the current release.

=item Are you sure what you have is a bug?

A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be
documented features in Perl.  Make sure the issue you've run into
isn't intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes
with the Perl distribution.

Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a trivial
undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests
the behaviour you're seeing is I<wrong>, your issue is likely to
receive more attention. You may want to start with B<perldoc>
L<perltrap> for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced)
Perl programmers run into.

If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run
across, B<perldoc> L<perldiag> for an explanation.  If the message
isn't in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl.  You may
have luck consulting your operating system documentation instead.

If you are on a non-UNIX platform B<perldoc> L<perlport>, as some
features may be unimplemented or work differently.

You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the Perl
debugger.  For information about how to use the debugger B<perldoc>
L<perldebug>.

=item Do you have a proper test case?

The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be
fixed -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be 
addressed.

A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple code;
few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no
platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug);
clear, simple documentation.

A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be included in
Perl's test suite.  If you have the time, consider writing your test case so
that it can be easily included into the standard test suite.

=item Have you included all relevant information?

Be sure to include the B<exact> error messages, if any.
"Perl gave an error" is not an exact error message.

If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
(B<dbx>, B<gdb>, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the bug
report.

NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
(often B<-g>), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use
because it will most probably contain only the function names and not
their arguments.  If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and
reproduce the crash and the stack trace.

=item Can you describe the bug in plain English?

The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely
it will be fixed.  Any insight you can provide into the problem
will help a great deal.  In other words, try to analyze the problem
(to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.

=item Can you fix the bug yourself?

If so, that's great news; bug reports with patches are likely to
receive significantly more attention and interest than those without
patches.  Please submit your patch via the GitHub Pull Request workflow
as described in B<perldoc> L<perlhack>.  You may also send patches to
B<perl5-porters@perl.org>.  When sending a patch, create it using
C<git format-patch> if possible, though a unified diff created with
C<diff -pu> will do nearly as well.

Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or requests for more
detailed explanations about your fix.

Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:

Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to diff is
typically the original file, the second argument your changed file).
Make sure you test your patch by applying it with C<git am> or the
C<patch> program before you send it on its way.  Try to follow the
same style as the code you are trying to patch.  Make sure your patch
really does work (C<make test>, if the thing you're patching is covered
by Perl's test suite).

=item Can you use C<perlbug> to submit a thank-you note?

Yes, you can do this by either using the C<-T> option, or by invoking
the program as C<perlthanks>. Thank-you notes are good. It makes people
smile. 

=back

Please make your issue title informative.  "a bug" is not informative.
Neither is "perl crashes" nor is "HELP!!!".  These don't help.  A compact
description of what's wrong is fine.

Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the
bug is in your code, or possibly to get no reply at all.  The
volunteers who maintain Perl are busy folks, so if your problem is
an obvious bug in your own code, is difficult to understand or is
a duplicate of an existing report, you may not receive a personal
reply.

If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the
issue tracker (you will be subscribed to notifications for issues you
submit or comment on) and the commit logs to development
versions of Perl, and encourage the maintainers with kind words or
offers of frosty beverages.  (Please do be kind to the maintainers.
Harassing or flaming them is likely to have the opposite effect of the
one you want.)

Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>
if a new version of Perl is released and your bug is still present.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-a>

Address to send the report to instead of saving to a file.

=item B<-b>

Body of the report.  If not included on the command line, or
in a file with B<-f>, you will get a chance to edit the report.

=item B<-C>

Don't send copy to administrator when sending report by mail.

=item B<-c>

Address to send copy of report to when sending report by mail.
Defaults to the address of the
local perl administrator (recorded when perl was built).

=item B<-d>

your configuration data, without saving or mailing anything.  You can use
this with B<-v> to get more complete data.

=item B<-e>

Editor to use.

=item B<-f>

File containing the body of the report.  Use this to quickly send a
prepared report.

=item B<-F>

File to output the results to.  Defaults to B<perlbug.rep>.

=item B<-h>

Prints a brief summary of the options.

=item B<-ok>

Report successful build on this system to perl porters. Forces B<-S>
and B<-C>. Forces and supplies values for B<-s> and B<-b>. Only
prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it (for use with
B<make>). Honors return address specified with B<-r>.  You can use this
with B<-v> to get more complete data.   Only makes a report if this
system is less than 60 days old.

=item B<-okay>

As B<-ok> except it will report on older systems.

=item B<-nok>

Report unsuccessful build on this system.  Forces B<-C>.  Forces and
supplies a value for B<-s>, then requires you to edit the report
and say what went wrong.  Alternatively, a prepared report may be
supplied using B<-f>.  Only prompts for a return address if it
cannot guess it (for use with B<make>). Honors return address
specified with B<-r>.  You can use this with B<-v> to get more

perlivp - Perl Installation Verification Procedure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<perlivp> [B<-p>] [B<-v>] [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<perlivp> program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the
Perl version it was built under.  It can be used after running:

    make install

(or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that B<perl> and its
libraries have been installed correctly.  A correct installation is verified
by output that looks like:

    ok 1
    ok 2

etc.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-h> help

Prints out a brief help message.

=item B<-p> print preface

Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.

=item B<-v> verbose

Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been performed.
Note that any failed tests ought to print out some extra information whether
or not -v is thrown.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item * print "# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n";

Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.

=item * print "# Perl version '$]' installed, expected $ivp_VERSION.\n";

Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.

=item * print "# Perl \@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\n";

Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.

=item * print "# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n";

One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the 
installation.  This is a serious error since it adversely affects perlivp's
ability to function.  You may be able to correct this by performing a
proper perl installation.

=item * print "# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n";

An attempt to C<eval "require $module"> failed, even though the list of 
extensions indicated that it should succeed.  Correct by conducting a proper 
installation.

=item * print "# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\n";

This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed 
a bLuRfle.pm module or that the C<eval " require \"$module_name.pm\"; ">
test may give misleading results with your installation of perl.  If yours
is the latter case then please let the author know.

=item * print "# file",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's'," missing from installation:\n";

One or more files turned up missing according to a run of 
C<ExtUtils::Installed -E<gt> validate()> over your installation.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.

=back

For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult the 
INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file for your 
platform.

Common options:
  -l,--list

  -r,--resolve encoding_alias
    resolve encoding to its (Encode) canonical name

     when omitted, the current locale will be used

     when omitted, the current locale will be used
  -s,--string string         
     "string" will be the input instead of STDIN or files
The following are mainly of interest to Encode hackers:
  -C N | -c           check the validity of the input
  -D,--debug          show debug information
  -S,--scheme scheme  use the scheme for conversion
Those are handy when you can only see ASCII characters:
  -p,--perlqq         transliterate characters missing in encoding to \\x{HHHH}
                      where HHHH is the hexadecimal Unicode code point
  --htmlcref          transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#NNN;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<piconv> is perl version of B<iconv>, a character encoding converter
widely available for various Unixen today.  This script was primarily
a technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
place of iconv for virtually any case.

piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or files
specified in the argument and prints out to STDOUT.
