return a list, and false otherwise.  In Perl 5.004, C<wantarray> can
also return the undefined value if a subroutine's return value will
not be used at all, which allows subroutines to avoid a time-consuming
calculation of a return value if it isn't going to be used.

=head2 C<eval EXPR> determines value of EXPR in scalar context

Perl (version 5) used to determine the value of EXPR inconsistently,
sometimes incorrectly using the surrounding context for the determination.
Now, the value of EXPR (before being parsed by eval) is always determined in
a scalar context.  Once parsed, it is executed as before, by providing
the context that the scope surrounding the eval provided.  This change
makes the behavior Perl4 compatible, besides fixing bugs resulting from
the inconsistent behavior.  This program:

    @a = qw(time now is time);
    print eval @a;
    print '|', scalar eval @a;

used to print something like "timenowis881399109|4", but now (and in perl4)
prints "4|4".

=head2 Changes to tainting checks

A bug in previous versions may have failed to detect some insecure
conditions when taint checks are turned on.  (Taint checks are used
in setuid or setgid scripts, or when explicitly turned on with the
C<-T> invocation option.)  Although it's unlikely, this may cause a
previously-working script to now fail, which should be construed
as a blessing since that indicates a potentially-serious security
hole was just plugged.

The new restrictions when tainting include:

=over 4

=item No glob() or <*>

These operators may spawn the C shell (csh), which cannot be made
safe.  This restriction will be lifted in a future version of Perl
when globbing is implemented without the use of an external program.

=item No spawning if tainted $CDPATH, $ENV, $BASH_ENV

These environment variables may alter the behavior of spawned programs
(especially shells) in ways that subvert security.  So now they are
treated as dangerous, in the manner of $IFS and $PATH.

=item No spawning if tainted $TERM doesn't look like a terminal name

Some termcap libraries do unsafe things with $TERM.  However, it would be
unnecessarily harsh to treat all $TERM values as unsafe, since only shell
metacharacters can cause trouble in $TERM.  So a tainted $TERM is
considered to be safe if it contains only alphanumerics, underscores,
dashes, and colons, and unsafe if it contains other characters (including
whitespace).

=back

=head2 New Opcode module and revised Safe module

A new Opcode module supports the creation, manipulation and
application of opcode masks.  The revised Safe module has a new API
and is implemented using the new Opcode module.  Please read the new
Opcode and Safe documentation.

=head2 Embedding improvements

In older versions of Perl it was not possible to create more than one
Perl interpreter instance inside a single process without leaking like a
sieve and/or crashing.  The bugs that caused this behavior have all been
fixed.  However, you still must take care when embedding Perl in a C
program.  See the updated perlembed manpage for tips on how to manage
your interpreters.

=head2 Internal change: FileHandle class based on IO::* classes

File handles are now stored internally as type IO::Handle.  The
FileHandle module is still supported for backwards compatibility, but
it is now merely a front end to the IO::* modules, specifically
IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, and IO::File.  We suggest, but do not
require, that you use the IO::* modules in new code.

In harmony with this change, C<*GLOB{FILEHANDLE}> is now just a
backward-compatible synonym for C<*GLOB{IO}>.

=head2 Internal change: PerlIO abstraction interface

It is now possible to build Perl with AT&T's sfio IO package
instead of stdio.  See L<perlapio> for more details, and
the F<INSTALL> file for how to use it.

=head2 New and changed syntax

=over 4

=item $coderef->(PARAMS)

A subroutine reference may now be suffixed with an arrow and a
(possibly empty) parameter list.  This syntax denotes a call of the
referenced subroutine, with the given parameters (if any).

This new syntax follows the pattern of S<C<< $hashref->{FOO} >>> and
S<C<< $aryref->[$foo] >>>: You may now write S<C<&$subref($foo)>> as
S<C<< $subref->($foo) >>>.  All these arrow terms may be chained;
thus, S<C<< &{$table->{FOO}}($bar) >>> may now be written
S<C<< $table->{FOO}->($bar) >>>.

=back

=head2 New and changed builtin constants

=over 4

=item __PACKAGE__

The current package name at compile time, or the undefined value if
there is no current package (due to a C<package;> directive).  Like
C<__FILE__> and C<__LINE__>, C<__PACKAGE__> does I<not> interpolate
into strings.

=back

=head2 New and changed builtin variables

=over 4

=item $^E

Extended error message on some platforms.  (Also known as
$EXTENDED_OS_ERROR if you C<use English>).

=item $^H

The current set of syntax checks enabled by C<use strict>.  See the
documentation of C<strict> for more details.  Not actually new, but
newly documented.
Because it is intended for internal use by Perl core components,
there is no C<use English> long name for this variable.

=item $^M

By default, running out of memory it is not trappable.  However, if
compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of C<$^M> as an emergency
pool after die()ing with this message.  Suppose that your Perl were
compiled with -DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK and used Perl's malloc.  Then

    $^M = 'a' x (1<<16);

would allocate a 64K buffer for use when in emergency.
See the F<INSTALL> file for information on how to enable this option.
As a disincentive to casual use of this advanced feature,
there is no C<use English> long name for this variable.

=back

=head2 New and changed builtin functions

=over 4

=item delete on slices

This now works.  (e.g. C<delete @ENV{'PATH', 'MANPATH'}>)

=item flock

is now supported on more platforms, prefers fcntl to lockf when
emulating, and always flushes before (un)locking.

=item printf and sprintf

Perl now implements these functions itself; it doesn't use the C
library function sprintf() any more, except for floating-point
numbers, and even then only known flags are allowed.  As a result, it
is now possible to know which conversions and flags will work, and
what they will do.

The new conversions in Perl's sprintf() are:

   %i	a synonym for %d
   %p	a pointer (the address of the Perl value, in hexadecimal)
   %n	special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
        into the next variable in the parameter list 

The new flags that go between the C<%> and the conversion are:

   #	prefix octal with "0", hex with "0x"
   h	interpret integer as C type "short" or "unsigned short"
   V	interpret integer as Perl's standard integer type

Also, where a number would appear in the flags, an asterisk ("*") may
be used instead, in which case Perl uses the next item in the
parameter list as the given number (that is, as the field width or
precision).  If a field width obtained through "*" is negative, it has
the same effect as the '-' flag: left-justification.

See L<perlfunc/sprintf> for a complete list of conversion and flags.

=item keys as an lvalue

As an lvalue, C<keys> allows you to increase the number of hash buckets
allocated for the given hash.  This can gain you a measure of efficiency if
you know the hash is going to get big.  (This is similar to pre-extending
an array by assigning a larger number to $#array.)  If you say

    keys %hash = 200;

then C<%hash> will have at least 200 buckets allocated for it.  These
buckets will be retained even if you do C<%hash = ()>; use C<undef
%hash> if you want to free the storage while C<%hash> is still in scope.
You can't shrink the number of buckets allocated for the hash using
C<keys> in this way (but you needn't worry about doing this by accident,
as trying has no effect).

=item my() in Control Structures

You can now use my() (with or without the parentheses) in the control
expressions of control structures such as:

    while (defined(my $line = <>)) {
        $line = lc $line;
    } continue {
        print $line;
    }

    if ((my $answer = <STDIN>) =~ /^y(es)?$/i) {
        user_agrees();
    } elsif ($answer =~ /^n(o)?$/i) {
        user_disagrees();
    } else {
        chomp $answer;
        die "`$answer' is neither `yes' nor `no'";
    }

Also, you can declare a foreach loop control variable as lexical by
preceding it with the word "my".  For example, in:

    foreach my $i (1, 2, 3) {
        some_function();
    }

$i is a lexical variable, and the scope of $i extends to the end of
the loop, but not beyond it.

Note that you still cannot use my() on global punctuation variables
such as $_ and the like.

=item pack() and unpack()

A new format 'w' represents a BER compressed integer (as defined in
ASN.1).  Its format is a sequence of one or more bytes, each of which
provides seven bits of the total value, with the most significant
first.  Bit eight of each byte is set, except for the last byte, in
which bit eight is clear.

If 'p' or 'P' are given undef as values, they now generate a NULL
pointer.

Both pack() and unpack() now fail when their templates contain invalid
types.  (Invalid types used to be ignored.)

=item sysseek()

The new sysseek() operator is a variant of seek() that sets and gets the
file's system read/write position, using the lseek(2) system call.  It is
the only reliable way to seek before using sysread() or syswrite().  Its
return value is the new position, or the undefined value on failure.

=item use VERSION

If the first argument to C<use> is a number, it is treated as a version
number instead of a module name.  If the version of the Perl interpreter
is less than VERSION, then an error message is printed and Perl exits
immediately.  Because C<use> occurs at compile time, this check happens
immediately during the compilation process, unlike C<require VERSION>,
which waits until runtime for the check.  This is often useful if you
need to check the current Perl version before C<use>ing library modules
which have changed in incompatible ways from older versions of Perl.
(We try not to do this more than we have to.)

=item use Module VERSION LIST

If the VERSION argument is present between Module and LIST, then the
C<use> will call the VERSION method in class Module with the given
version as an argument.  The default VERSION method, inherited from
the UNIVERSAL class, croaks if the given version is larger than the
value of the variable $Module::VERSION.  (Note that there is not a
comma after VERSION!)

This version-checking mechanism is similar to the one currently used
in the Exporter module, but it is faster and can be used with modules
that don't use the Exporter.  It is the recommended method for new
code.

=item prototype(FUNCTION)

Returns the prototype of a function as a string (or C<undef> if the
function has no prototype).  FUNCTION is a reference to or the name of the
function whose prototype you want to retrieve.
(Not actually new; just never documented before.)

=item srand

The default seed for C<srand>, which used to be C<time>, has been changed.
Now it's a heady mix of difficult-to-predict system-dependent values,
which should be sufficient for most everyday purposes.

Previous to version 5.004, calling C<rand> without first calling C<srand>
would yield the same sequence of random numbers on most or all machines.
Now, when perl sees that you're calling C<rand> and haven't yet called
C<srand>, it calls C<srand> with the default seed. You should still call
C<srand> manually if your code might ever be run on a pre-5.004 system,
of course, or if you want a seed other than the default.

=item $_ as Default

Functions documented in the Camel to default to $_ now in
fact do, and all those that do are so documented in L<perlfunc>.

=item C<m//gc> does not reset search position on failure

The C<m//g> match iteration construct has always reset its target
string's search position (which is visible through the C<pos> operator)
when a match fails; as a result, the next C<m//g> match after a failure
starts again at the beginning of the string.  With Perl 5.004, this
reset may be disabled by adding the "c" (for "continue") modifier,
i.e. C<m//gc>.  This feature, in conjunction with the C<\G> zero-width
assertion, makes it possible to chain matches together.  See L<perlop>
and L<perlre>.

=item C<m//x> ignores whitespace before ?*+{}

The C<m//x> construct has always been intended to ignore all unescaped
whitespace.  However, before Perl 5.004, whitespace had the effect of
escaping repeat modifiers like "*" or "?"; for example, C</a *b/x> was
(mis)interpreted as C</a\*b/x>.  This bug has been fixed in 5.004.

=item nested C<sub{}> closures work now

Prior to the 5.004 release, nested anonymous functions didn't work
right.  They do now.

=item formats work right on changing lexicals

Just like anonymous functions that contain lexical variables
that change (like a lexical index variable for a C<foreach> loop),
formats now work properly.  For example, this silently failed
before (printed only zeros), but is fine now:

    my $i;
    foreach $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
	write;
    }
    format =
	my i is @#
	$i
    .

However, it still fails (without a warning) if the foreach is within a
subroutine:

    my $i;
    sub foo {
      foreach $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
	write;
      }
    }
    foo;
    format =
	my i is @#
	$i
    .

=back

=head2 New builtin methods

The C<UNIVERSAL> package automatically contains the following methods that
are inherited by all other classes:

=over 4

=item isa(CLASS)

C<isa> returns I<true> if its object is blessed into a subclass of C<CLASS>

C<isa> is also exportable and can be called as a sub with two arguments. This
allows the ability to check what a reference points to. Example:

    use UNIVERSAL qw(isa);

    if(isa($ref, 'ARRAY')) {
       ...
    }

=item can(METHOD)

C<can> checks to see if its object has a method called C<METHOD>,
if it does then a reference to the sub is returned; if it does not then
I<undef> is returned.

=item VERSION( [NEED] )

C<VERSION> returns the version number of the class (package).  If the
NEED argument is given then it will check that the current version (as
defined by the $VERSION variable in the given package) not less than
NEED; it will die if this is not the case.  This method is normally
called as a class method.  This method is called automatically by the
C<VERSION> form of C<use>.

    use A 1.2 qw(some imported subs);
    # implies:
    A->VERSION(1.2);

=back

B<NOTE:> C<can> directly uses Perl's internal code for method lookup, and
C<isa> uses a very similar method and caching strategy. This may cause
strange effects if the Perl code dynamically changes @ISA in any package.

You may add other methods to the UNIVERSAL class via Perl or XS code.
You do not need to C<use UNIVERSAL> in order to make these methods
available to your program.  This is necessary only if you wish to
have C<isa> available as a plain subroutine in the current package.

=head2 TIEHANDLE now supported

See L<perltie> for other kinds of tie()s.

=over 4

=item TIEHANDLE classname, LIST

This is the constructor for the class.  That means it is expected to
return an object of some sort. The reference can be used to
hold some internal information.

    sub TIEHANDLE {
	print "<shout>\n";
	my $i;
	return bless \$i, shift;
    }

=item PRINT this, LIST

This method will be triggered every time the tied handle is printed to.
Beyond its self reference it also expects the list that was passed to
the print function.

    sub PRINT {
	$r = shift;
	$$r++;
	return print join( $, => map {uc} @_), $\;
    }

=item PRINTF this, LIST

This method will be triggered every time the tied handle is printed to
with the C<printf()> function.
Beyond its self reference it also expects the format and list that was
passed to the printf function.

    sub PRINTF {
        shift;
	  my $fmt = shift;
        print sprintf($fmt, @_)."\n";
    }

=item READ this LIST

This method will be called when the handle is read from via the C<read>
or C<sysread> functions.

    sub READ {
	$r = shift;
	my($buf,$len,$offset) = @_;
	print "READ called, \$buf=$buf, \$len=$len, \$offset=$offset";
    }

=item READLINE this

This method will be called when the handle is read from. The method
should return undef when there is no more data.

    sub READLINE {
	$r = shift;
	return "PRINT called $$r times\n"
    }

=item GETC this

This method will be called when the C<getc> function is called.

    sub GETC { print "Don't GETC, Get Perl"; return "a"; }

=item DESTROY this

As with the other types of ties, this method will be called when the
tied handle is about to be destroyed. This is useful for debugging and
possibly for cleaning up.

    sub DESTROY {
	print "</shout>\n";
    }

=back

=head2 Malloc enhancements

If perl is compiled with the malloc included with the perl distribution
(that is, if C<perl -V:d_mymalloc> is 'define') then you can print
memory statistics at runtime by running Perl thusly:

  env PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl your_script_here

The value of 2 means to print statistics after compilation and on
exit; with a value of 1, the statistics are printed only on exit.
(If you want the statistics at an arbitrary time, you'll need to
install the optional module Devel::Peek.)

Three new compilation flags are recognized by malloc.c.  (They have no
effect if perl is compiled with system malloc().)

=over 4

=item -DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK

If this macro is defined, running out of memory need not be a fatal
error: a memory pool can allocated by assigning to the special
variable C<$^M>.  See L</"$^M">.

=item -DPACK_MALLOC

Perl memory allocation is by bucket with sizes close to powers of two.
Because of these malloc overhead may be big, especially for data of
size exactly a power of two.  If C<PACK_MALLOC> is defined, perl uses
a slightly different algorithm for small allocations (up to 64 bytes
long), which makes it possible to have overhead down to 1 byte for
allocations which are powers of two (and appear quite often).

Expected memory savings (with 8-byte alignment in C<alignbytes>) is
about 20% for typical Perl usage.  Expected slowdown due to additional
malloc overhead is in fractions of a percent (hard to measure, because
of the effect of saved memory on speed).

=item -DTWO_POT_OPTIMIZE

Similarly to C<PACK_MALLOC>, this macro improves allocations of data
with size close to a power of two; but this works for big allocations
(starting with 16K by default).  Such allocations are typical for big
hashes and special-purpose scripts, especially image processing.

On recent systems, the fact that perl requires 2M from system for 1M
allocation will not affect speed of execution, since the tail of such
a chunk is not going to be touched (and thus will not require real
memory).  However, it may result in a premature out-of-memory error.
So if you will be manipulating very large blocks with sizes close to
powers of two, it would be wise to define this macro.

Expected saving of memory is 0-100% (100% in applications which
require most memory in such 2**n chunks); expected slowdown is
negligible.

=back

=head2 Miscellaneous efficiency enhancements

Functions that have an empty prototype and that do nothing but return
a fixed value are now inlined (e.g. C<sub PI () { 3.14159 }>).

Each unique hash key is only allocated once, no matter how many hashes
have an entry with that key.  So even if you have 100 copies of the
same hash, the hash keys never have to be reallocated.

=head1 Support for More Operating Systems

Support for the following operating systems is new in Perl 5.004.

=head2 Win32

Perl 5.004 now includes support for building a "native" perl under
Windows NT, using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (versions 2.0
and above) or the Borland C++ compiler (versions 5.02 and above).
The resulting perl can be used under Windows 95 (if it
is installed in the same directory locations as it got installed
in Windows NT).  This port includes support for perl extension
building tools like L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> and L<h2xs>, so that many extensions
available on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) can now be
readily built under Windows NT.  See http://www.perl.com/ for more
information on CPAN and F<README.win32> in the perl distribution for more
details on how to get started with building this port.

There is also support for building perl under the Cygwin32 environment.
Cygwin32 is a set of GNU tools that make it possible to compile and run
many Unix programs under Windows NT by providing a mostly Unix-like 
interface for compilation and execution.  See F<README.cygwin32> in the
perl distribution for more details on this port and how to obtain the
Cygwin32 toolkit.

=head2 Plan 9

See F<README.plan9> in the perl distribution.

=head2 QNX

See F<README.qnx> in the perl distribution.

=head2 AmigaOS

See F<README.amigaos> in the perl distribution.

=head1 Pragmata

Six new pragmatic modules exist:

=over 4

=item use autouse MODULE => qw(sub1 sub2 sub3)

Defers C<require MODULE> until someone calls one of the specified
subroutines (which must be exported by MODULE).  This pragma should be
used with caution, and only when necessary.

=item use blib

=item use blib 'dir'

Looks for MakeMaker-like I<'blib'> directory structure starting in
I<dir> (or current directory) and working back up to five levels of
parent directories.

Intended for use on command line with B<-M> option as a way of testing
arbitrary scripts against an uninstalled version of a package.

=item use constant NAME => VALUE

Provides a convenient interface for creating compile-time constants,
See L<perlsub/"Constant Functions">.

=item use locale

Tells the compiler to enable (or disable) the use of POSIX locales for
builtin operations.

When C<use locale> is in effect, the current LC_CTYPE locale is used
for regular expressions and case mapping; LC_COLLATE for string
ordering; and LC_NUMERIC for numeric formatting in printf and sprintf
(but B<not> in print).  LC_NUMERIC is always used in write, since
lexical scoping of formats is problematic at best.

Each C<use locale> or C<no locale> affects statements to the end of
the enclosing BLOCK or, if not inside a BLOCK, to the end of the
current file.  Locales can be switched and queried with
POSIX::setlocale().

See L<perllocale> for more information.

=item use ops

Disable unsafe opcodes, or any named opcodes, when compiling Perl code.

=item use vmsish

Enable VMS-specific language features.  Currently, there are three
VMS-specific features available: 'status', which makes C<$?> and
C<system> return genuine VMS status values instead of emulating POSIX;
'exit', which makes C<exit> take a genuine VMS status value instead of
assuming that C<exit 1> is an error; and 'time', which makes all times
relative to the local time zone, in the VMS tradition.

=back

=head1 Modules

=head2 Required Updates

Though Perl 5.004 is compatible with almost all modules that work
with Perl 5.003, there are a few exceptions:

    Module   Required Version for Perl 5.004
    ------   -------------------------------
    Filter   Filter-1.12
    LWP      libwww-perl-5.08
    Tk       Tk400.202 (-w makes noise)

Also, the majordomo mailing list program, version 1.94.1, doesn't work
with Perl 5.004 (nor with perl 4), because it executes an invalid
regular expression.  This bug is fixed in majordomo version 1.94.2.

=head2 Installation directories

The I<installperl> script now places the Perl source files for
extensions in the architecture-specific library directory, which is
where the shared libraries for extensions have always been.  This
change is intended to allow administrators to keep the Perl 5.004
library directory unchanged from a previous version, without running
the risk of binary incompatibility between extensions' Perl source and
shared libraries.

    UNIVERSAL.pm         Base class for *ALL* classes

=head2 Fcntl

New constants in the existing Fcntl modules are now supported,
provided that your operating system happens to support them:

    F_GETOWN F_SETOWN
    O_ASYNC O_DEFER O_DSYNC O_FSYNC O_SYNC
    O_EXLOCK O_SHLOCK

These constants are intended for use with the Perl operators sysopen()
and fcntl() and the basic database modules like SDBM_File.  For the
exact meaning of these and other Fcntl constants please refer to your
operating system's documentation for fcntl() and open().

In addition, the Fcntl module now provides these constants for use
with the Perl operator flock():

	LOCK_SH LOCK_EX LOCK_NB LOCK_UN

These constants are defined in all environments (because where there is
no flock() system call, Perl emulates it).  However, for historical
reasons, these constants are not exported unless they are explicitly
requested with the ":flock" tag (e.g. C<use Fcntl ':flock'>).

=head2 IO

The IO module provides a simple mechanism to load all the IO modules at one
go.  Currently this includes:

     IO::Handle
     IO::Seekable
     IO::File
     IO::Pipe
     IO::Socket

For more information on any of these modules, please see its
respective documentation.

=head2 Math::Complex

The Math::Complex module has been totally rewritten, and now supports
more operations.  These are overloaded:

     + - * / ** <=> neg ~ abs sqrt exp log sin cos atan2 "" (stringify)

And these functions are now exported:

    pi i Re Im arg
    log10 logn ln cbrt root
    tan
    csc sec cot
    asin acos atan
    acsc asec acot
    sinh cosh tanh
    csch sech coth
    asinh acosh atanh
    acsch asech acoth
    cplx cplxe

=head2 Math::Trig

This new module provides a simpler interface to parts of Math::Complex for
those who need trigonometric functions only for real numbers.

=head2 DB_File

There have been quite a few changes made to DB_File. Here are a few of
the highlights:

=over 4

=item *

Fixed a handful of bugs.

=item *

By public demand, added support for the standard hash function exists().

=item *

Made it compatible with Berkeley DB 1.86.

=item *

Made negative subscripts work with RECNO interface.

=item *

Changed the default flags from O_RDWR to O_CREAT|O_RDWR and the default
mode from 0640 to 0666.

=item *

Made DB_File automatically import the open() constants (O_RDWR,
O_CREAT etc.) from Fcntl, if available.

=item *

Updated documentation.

=back

Refer to the HISTORY section in DB_File.pm for a complete list of
changes. Everything after DB_File 1.01 has been added since 5.003.

=head2 Net::Ping

Major rewrite - support added for both udp echo and real icmp pings.

=head2 Object-oriented overrides for builtin operators

Many of the Perl builtins returning lists now have
object-oriented overrides.  These are:

    File::stat
    Net::hostent
    Net::netent
    Net::protoent
    Net::servent
    Time::gmtime
    Time::localtime
    User::grent
    User::pwent

For example, you can now say

    use File::stat;
    use User::pwent;
    $his = (stat($filename)->st_uid == pwent($whoever)->pw_uid);

=head1 Utility Changes

=head2 pod2html

=over 4

=item Sends converted HTML to standard output

The I<pod2html> utility included with Perl 5.004 is entirely new.
By default, it sends the converted HTML to its standard output,
instead of writing it to a file like Perl 5.003's I<pod2html> did.
Use the B<--outfile=FILENAME> option to write to a file.

=back

=head2 xsubpp

=over 4

=item C<void> XSUBs now default to returning nothing

Due to a documentation/implementation bug in previous versions of
Perl, XSUBs with a return type of C<void> have actually been
returning one value.  Usually that value was the GV for the XSUB,
but sometimes it was some already freed or reused value, which would
sometimes lead to program failure.

In Perl 5.004, if an XSUB is declared as returning C<void>, it
actually returns no value, i.e. an empty list (though there is a
backward-compatibility exception; see below).  If your XSUB really
does return an SV, you should give it a return type of C<SV *>.

For backward compatibility, I<xsubpp> tries to guess whether a
C<void> XSUB is really C<void> or if it wants to return an C<SV *>.
It does so by examining the text of the XSUB: if I<xsubpp> finds
what looks like an assignment to C<ST(0)>, it assumes that the
XSUB's return type is really C<SV *>.

=head1 C Language API Changes

=over 4

=item C<gv_fetchmethod> and C<perl_call_sv>

The C<gv_fetchmethod> function finds a method for an object, just like
in Perl 5.003.  The GV it returns may be a method cache entry.
However, in Perl 5.004, method cache entries are not visible to users;
therefore, they can no longer be passed directly to C<perl_call_sv>.
Instead, you should use the C<GvCV> macro on the GV to extract its CV,
and pass the CV to C<perl_call_sv>.

The most likely symptom of passing the result of C<gv_fetchmethod> to
C<perl_call_sv> is Perl's producing an "Undefined subroutine called"
error on the I<second> call to a given method (since there is no cache
on the first call).

=item C<perl_eval_pv>

A new function handy for eval'ing strings of Perl code inside C code.
This function returns the value from the eval statement, which can
be used instead of fetching globals from the symbol table.  See
L<perlguts>, L<perlembed> and L<perlcall> for details and examples.

=item Extended API for manipulating hashes

Internal handling of hash keys has changed.  The old hashtable API is
still fully supported, and will likely remain so.  The additions to the
API allow passing keys as C<SV*>s, so that C<tied> hashes can be given
real scalars as keys rather than plain strings (nontied hashes still
can only use strings as keys).  New extensions must use the new hash
access functions and macros if they wish to use C<SV*> keys.  These
additions also make it feasible to manipulate C<HE*>s (hash entries),
which can be more efficient.  See L<perlguts> for details.
