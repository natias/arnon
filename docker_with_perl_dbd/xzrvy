License: Artistic
 The "Artistic License"
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
 "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
 created through textual modification.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
 modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
 of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 .
 "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
 copyrights for the package.
 .
 "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
 this Package.
 .
 "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
 basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
 and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
 Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
 as a market that must bear the fee.)
 .
 "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
 itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
 It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
 under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
     to get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
     the Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
 distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
 product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
 an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
 form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
 interpreter is so embedded.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
 Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
 binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
 neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
 fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
 not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
 Package.
 .
 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
 languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
 emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
 Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
 equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
 not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
 regression tests for the language.
 .
 8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
 permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
 when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
 to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
 construed as a distribution of this Package.
 .
 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 .
 10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .

binaries for MySQL and variant server daemons only. These are intended
for users who wish to manage database data directories and daemon and
service configurations themselves.

Debian packages of the form <variant>-server-<version> depend on the
corresponding <variant>-server-core-<version> packages and add automatic
management of database data directories and daemon and service
configuration via maintainer scripts.

It is possible for a <variant>-server-<version> maintainer script to
detect a local customisation that means that it cannot continue. Each
known case is documented in a separate file in this directory.

When such a situation arises, the <variant>-server-<version> maintainer
scripts will enter "frozen mode". We consider this preferable to the
maintainer script failing with a non-zero return code, which was the
previous behaviour. The previous behaviour would cause dpkg to fail,
causing apt to fail, leaving system packaging in a broken state and
causing a release upgrade to fail for example. This seemed excessive for
what could be an intended configuration change by the user.

Instead, "frozen mode" stops the <variant>-server-<version> maintainer
scripts from making changes until the user intervenes. The maintainer
scripts will not start the daemon, perform database upgrades or make
similar changes.

When "/etc/mysql/FROZEN" exists (even if it is a broken symlink), then
frozen mode is defined to be turned on. Usually a maintainer script
turning frozen mode on will create a symlink at /etc/mysql/FROZEN
pointing to further documentation on the specific case encountered in
this directory with an explanation and suggestions for resolution.

To resolve frozen mode, resolve the situation documented by
/etc/mysql/FROZEN and only then remove the /etc/mysql/FROZEN symlink,
and run "dpkg-reconfigure <package>" where <package> should usually be
in the form <variant>-server-<version>.

Maintainer
scripts will avoid making changes or starting the daemon until manually
released from this state. See /usr/share/doc/mysql-common/README for
general information about this mode.

In this particular case, an incompatible downgrade attempt has been
detected. This can be resolved in one of two ways:

1. Change the contents of /var/lib/mysql/ to contain database data that
is compatible with the currently installed MySQL or variant daemon
version. For example: you could restore from a backup. Alternatively you
could do a dump using a future version binary and then a restore using
the current version binary.

2. Switch to a MySQL or variant daemon version that is compatible with
the data currently in /var/lib/mysql/. For example, if you have
attempted a downgrade from mysql-server-5.7 to mysql-server-5.6, you
could "apt install mysql-server-5.7" again.

Please resolve this situation and only then remove the /etc/mysql/FROZEN
symlink. You can then run "dpkg-reconfigure <package>" where <package>
should usually be in the form <variant>-server-<version>.

This version of patch has many changes made by the Free Software Foundation.
They add support for:
 * handling arbitrary binary data and large files
 * the unified context diff format that GNU diff can produce
 * merging into files instead of creating reject files
 * making GNU Emacs-style backup files
 * improved interaction with RCS and SCCS
 * the GNU conventions for option parsing and configuring and compilation.
 * better POSIX compliance
They also fix some bugs.

If you obtained this file as part of a "git clone", then see the
README-hacking file.  If this file came to you as part of a tar archive,
then see the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.
A more detailed description of all changes can be found in the file ChangeLog
in tar archives, and with "git log" which shows the version control history.

Tutorial-style documentation for patch is included in the GNU
Diffutils package; get GNU Diffutils 2.8 or later for up-to-date
documentation for patch.

Use `configure --disable-largefile' to disable large file support;
this is reportedly necessary on Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.0 to avoid a C library bug.
For MS-DOS using DJGPP tools, see the file pc/djgpp/README.
For other systems, copy config.hin to config.h and change
#undef statements in it to #define as appropriate for your system,
and copy Makefile.in to Makefile and set the variables that are
enclosed in @ signs as appropriate for your system.

Please send bug reports for this version of patch to
<bug-patch@gnu.org>.

The Free Software Foundation is distributing this version of patch
independently because as of this writing, Larry Wall has not released a
new version of patch since mid-1988.  We have heard that he has been
too busy working on other things, like Perl.  He has graciously agreed
to let GNU `patch' be distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.
