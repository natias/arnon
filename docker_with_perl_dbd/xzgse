=item ora_piece_size

This is the max piece size for the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback>
and L</Piecewise Fetch with Polling> methods, in chars for CLOBS, and
bytes for BLOBS.

=item ora_check_sql

If 1 (default), force SELECT statements to be described in prepare().
If 0, allow SELECT statements to defer describe until execute().

See L</Prepare Postponed Till Execute> for more information.

=item ora_exe_mode

This will set the execute mode of the current statement. Presently
only one mode is supported;

  OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY - make result set scrollable

See L</SCROLLABLE CURSORS> for more details.

=item ora_prefetch_rows

Sets the number of rows to be prefetched. If it is not set, then the
default value is 1.  See L</Row Prefetching> for more details.

=item ora_prefetch_memory

Sets the memory level for rows to be prefetched. The application then
fetches as many rows as will fit into that much memory.  See L</Row
Prefetching> for more details.

=item ora_row_cache_off

By default DBD::Oracle will use a row cache when fetching to cut down
the number of round trips to the server. If you do not want to use an
array fetch set this value to any value other than 0;

See L</Row Prefetching> for more details.

=back

=head3 B<Placeholders>

There are three types of placeholders that can be used in
DBD::Oracle.

The first is the "question mark" type, in which each placeholder is
represented by a single question mark character. This is the method
recommended by the DBI and is the most portable. Each question
mark is internally replaced by a "dollar sign number" in the order in
which they appear in the query (important when using L</bind_param>).

The second type of placeholder is "named parameters" in the format
":foo" which is the one Oracle prefers.

   $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
   $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name LIKE :name");
   $sth->bind_param(':name', "John%");
   $sth->execute;
   DBI::dump_results($sth);

Note when calling bind_param with named parameters you must include
the leading colon. The advantage of this placeholder type is that you
can use the same placeholder more than once in the same SQL statement
but you only need to bind it once.

The last placeholder type is a variation of the two above where you
name each placeholder :N (where N is a number). Like the named
placeholders above you can use the same placeholder multiple times in
the SQL but when you call bind_param you only need to pass the N
(e.g., for :1 you use bind_param(1,...) and not bind_param(':1',...).

The different types of placeholders cannot be mixed within a statement, but you may
use different ones for each statement handle you have. This is confusing at best, so
stick to one style within your program.

=head2 B<prepare_cached>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare_cached($statement, \%attr);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact. This method is most useful
if the same query is used over and over as it will cut down round trips to the server.

=head2 B<do>

  $rv = $dbh->do($statement);
  $rv = $dbh->do($statement, \%attr);
  $rv = $dbh->do($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows affected if the
query was successful, returns undef if an error occurred, and returns -1 if the
number of rows is unknown or not available. Note that this method will return B<0E0> instead
of 0 for 'no rows were affected', in order to always return a true value if no error occurred.

=head2 B<last_insert_id>

Oracle does not implement auto_increment of serial type columns it uses predefined
sequences where the id numbers are either selected before insert, at insert time with a trigger,
 or as part of the query.

Below is an example of you to use the latter with the SQL returning clause to get the ID number back
on insert with the bind_param_inout method.
.

  $dbh->do('CREATE SEQUENCE lii_seq START 1');
  $dbh->do(q{CREATE TABLE lii (
    foobar INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    baz VARCHAR)});
  $SQL = "INSERT INTO lii (foobar,baz) VALUES (lii_seq.nextval,'XX') returning foobar into :p_new_id";";
  $sth = $dbh->prepare($SQL);
  my $p_new_id='-1';
  $sth->bind_param_inout(":p_new_id",\$p_new_id,38);
  $sth->execute();
  $db->commit();

=head2 B<commit>

  $rv = $dbh->commit;

Issues a COMMIT to the server, indicating that the current transaction is finished and that
all changes made will be visible to other processes. If AutoCommit is enabled, then
a warning is given and no COMMIT is issued. Returns true on success, false on error.

=head2 B<rollback>

  $rv = $dbh->rollback;

Issues a ROLLBACK to the server, which discards any changes made in the current transaction. If AutoCommit
is enabled, then a warning is given and no ROLLBACK is issued. Returns true on success, and
false on error.

=head2 B<begin_work>

This method turns on transactions until the next call to L</commit> or L</rollback>, if L</AutoCommit> is
currently enabled. If it is not enabled, calling begin_work will issue an error. Note that the
transaction will not actually begin until the first statement after begin_work is called.

=head2 B<disconnect>

  $rv = $dbh->disconnect;

Disconnects from the Oracle database. Any uncommitted changes will be rolled back upon disconnection. It's
good policy to always explicitly call commit or rollback at some point before disconnecting, rather than
relying on the default rollback behavior.

If the script exits before disconnect is called (or, more precisely, if the database handle is no longer
referenced by anything), then the database handle's DESTROY method will call the rollback() and disconnect()
methods automatically. It is best to explicitly disconnect rather than rely on this behavior.

=head2 B<ping>

  $rv = $dbh->ping;

This C<ping> method is used to check the validity of a database handle. The value returned is
either 0, indicating that the connection is no longer valid, or 1, indicating the connection is valid.
This function does 1 round trip to the Oracle Server.

=head2 B<get_info()>

 $value = $dbh->get_info($info_type);

DBD::Oracle supports C<get_info()>, but (currently) only a few info types.

=head2 B<table_info()>

DBD::Oracle supports attributes for C<table_info()>.

In Oracle, the concept of I<user> and I<schema> is (currently) the
same. Because database objects are owned by an user, the owner names
in the data dictionary views correspond to schema names.
Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.

Search patterns are supported for TABLE_SCHEM and TABLE_NAME.

TABLE_TYPE may contain a comma-separated list of table types.
The following table types are supported:

  TABLE
  VIEW
  SYNONYM
  SEQUENCE

The result set is ordered by TABLE_TYPE, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME.

The special enumerations of catalogues, schemas and table types are
supported. However, TABLE_CAT is always NULL.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
C<table_info()> performs a case-sensitive search. So, a selection
criterion should respect upper and lower case.
Normally, an identifier is case-insensitive. Oracle stores and
returns it in upper case. Sometimes, database objects are created
with quoted identifiers (for reserved words, mixed case, special
characters, ...). Such an identifier is case-sensitive (if not all
upper case). Oracle stores and returns it as given.
C<table_info()> has no special quote handling, neither adds nor
removes quotes.

=head2 B<primary_key_info()>

Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.
The TABLE_CAT field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

If the primary key constraint was created without an identifier,
PK_NAME contains a system generated name with the form SYS_Cn.

The result set is ordered by TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, KEY_SEQ.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

=head2 B<foreign_key_info()>

This method (currently) supports the extended behaviour of SQL/CLI, i.e. the
result set contains foreign keys that refer to primary B<and> alternate keys.
The field UNIQUE_OR_PRIMARY distinguishes these keys.

Oracle does not support catalogues, so C<$pk_catalog> and C<$fk_catalog> are
ignored as selection criteria (in the new style interface).
The UK_TABLE_CAT and FK_TABLE_CAT fields of a fetched row are always
NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

If the primary or foreign key constraints were created without an identifier,
UK_NAME or FK_NAME contains a system generated name with the form SYS_Cn.

The UPDATE_RULE field is always 3 ('NO ACTION'), because Oracle (currently)
does not support other actions.

The DELETE_RULE field may contain wrong values. This is a known Bug (#1271663)
in Oracle's data dictionary views. Currently (as of 8.1.7), 'RESTRICT' and
'SET DEFAULT' are not supported, 'CASCADE' is mapped correctly and all other
actions (incl. 'SET NULL') appear as 'NO ACTION'.

The DEFERABILITY field is always NULL, because this columns is
not present in the ALL_CONSTRAINTS view of older Oracle releases.

The result set is ordered by UK_TABLE_SCHEM, UK_TABLE_NAME, FK_TABLE_SCHEM,
FK_TABLE_NAME, ORDINAL_POSITION.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

=head2 B<column_info()>

Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.
The TABLE_CAT field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

The CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH field is (currently) always NULL (undef).

Don't rely on the values of the BUFFER_LENGTH field!
Especially the length of FLOATs may be wrong.

Datatype codes for non-standard types are subject to change.

Attention! The DATA_DEFAULT (COLUMN_DEF) column is of type LONG so you
may have to set LongReadLen on the connection handle before calling
column_info if you have a large default column. After DBD::Oracle 1.40
LongReadLen is set automatically to 1Mb when calling column_info and
reset aftwerwards.

The result set is ordered by TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, ORDINAL_POSITION.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

It is possible with Oracle to make the names of the various DB objects (table,column,index etc)
case sensitive.

  alter table bloggind add ("Bla_BLA" NUMBER)

So in the example the exact case "Bla_BLA" must be used to get it info on the column. While this

 alter table bloggind add (Bla_BLA NUMBER)

any case can be used to get info on the column.

=head2 B<statistics_info()>

Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.
The TABLE_CAT field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

The INDEX_QUALIFIER field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef),
for the same reason as for TABLE_CAT.

If an index was created without an identifier
(e.g. in the course of a PK creation),
INDEX_NAME contains a system generated name with the form SYS_.

COLUMN_NAME may contain a system generated name
(e.g. for function-based indexes).

For the TYPE column, a simple mapping is used:

  NORMAL   btree
  CLUSTER  clustered
  ...      other

The C<$quick> parameter is currently ignored.
The method uses the dictionary with the gathered statistics,
thus cannot ensure that the values for CARDINALITY and PAGES are current.

The result set is ordered by
NON_UNIQUE, TYPE, INDEX_QUALIFIER, INDEX_NAME, ORDINAL_POSITION.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

=head2 B<selectrow_array>

  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($sql);
  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($sql, \%attr);
  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Returns an array of row information after preparing and executing the provided SQL string. The rows are returned
by calling L</fetchrow_array>. The string can also be a statement handle generated by a previous prepare. Note that
only the first row of data is returned. If called in a scalar context, only the first column of the first row is
returned. Because this is not portable, it is not recommended that you use this method in that way.

=head2 B<selectrow_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectrow_arrayref($statement);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectrow_arrayref($statement, \%attr);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectrow_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Exactly the same as L</selectrow_array>, except that it returns a reference to an array, by internal use of
the L</fetchrow_arrayref> method.

=head2 B<selectrow_hashref>

  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectrow_hashref($sql);
  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectrow_hashref($sql, \%attr);
  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectrow_hashref($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Exactly the same as L</selectrow_array>, except that it returns a reference to an hash, by internal use of
the L</fetchrow_hashref> method.

=head2 B<clone>

  $other_dbh = $dbh->clone();

Creates a copy of the database handle by connecting with the same parameters as the original
handle, then trying to merge the attributes. See the DBI documentation for complete usage.

=head1 DATABASE HANDLE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<AutoCommit> (boolean)

Supported by DBD::Oracle as proposed by DBI.The default of AutoCommit is on, but this may change
in the future, so it is highly recommended that you explicitly set it when
calling L</connect>.

=head2 B<ReadOnly> (boolean)

  $dbh->{ReadOnly} = 1;

Specifies if the current database connection should be in read-only mode or not.

Please not that this method is not foolproof: there are still ways to update the
database. Consider this a safety net to catch applications that should not be
issuing commands such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

This method method requires DBI version 1.55 or better.

=head2 B<Name> (string, read-only)

Returns the name of the current database. This is the same as the DSN, without the
"dbi:Oracle:" part.

=head2 B<Username> (string, read-only)

Returns the name of the user connected to the database.

=head2 B<Driver> (handle, read-only)

Holds the handle of the parent driver. The only recommended use for this is to find the name
of the driver using:

  $dbh->{Driver}->{Name}

=head2 B<RowCacheSize>

DBD::Oracle supports both Server pre-fetch and Client side row caching. By default both
are turned on to give optimum performance. Most of the time one can just let DBD::Oracle
figure out the best optimization.

=head3 B<Row Caching>

Row caching occurs on the client side and the object of it is to cut down the number of round
trips made to the server when fetching rows. At each fetch a set number of rows will be retrieved
from the server and stored locally. Further calls the server are made only when the end of the
local buffer(cache) is reached.

Rows up to the specified top level row
count C<RowCacheSize> are fetched if it occupies no more than the specified memory usage limit.
The default value is 0, which means that memory size is not included in computing the number of rows to prefetch. If
the C<RowCacheSize> value is set to a negative number then the positive value of RowCacheSize is used
to compute the number of rows to prefetch.

By default C<RowCacheSize> is automatically set. If you want to totally turn off prefetching set this to 1.

For any SQL statement that contains a LOB, Long or Object Type Row Caching will be turned off. However server side
caching still works.  If you are only selecting a LOB Locator then Row Caching will still work.

=head3 Row Prefetching

Row prefetching occurs on the server side and uses the DBI database handle attribute C<RowCacheSize> and or the
Prepare Attribute 'ora_prefetch_memory'. Tweaking these values may yield improved performance.

  $dbh->{RowCacheSize} = 100;
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL,{ora_exe_mode=>OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY,ora_prefetch_memory=>10000});

In the above example 10 rows will be prefetched up to a maximum of 10000 bytes of data.  The Oracle Call Interface Programmer's Guide,
suggests a good row cache value for a scrollable cursor is about 20% of expected size of the record set.

The prefetch settings tell the DBD::Oracle to grab x rows (or x-bytes) when it needs to get new rows. This happens on the first
fetch that sets the current position to any value other than 0. In the above example if we do a OCI_FETCH_FIRST the first 10 rows are
loaded into the buffer and DBD::Oracle will not have to go back to the server for more rows. When record 11 is fetched DBD::Oracle
fetches and returns this row and the next 9 rows are loaded into the buffer. In this case if you fetch backwards from 10 to 1
no server round trips are made.

With large record sets it is best not to attempt to go to the last record as this may take some time, A large buffer size might even slow down
the fetch. If you must get the number of rows in a large record set you might try using an few large OCI_FETCH_ABSOLUTEs and then an OCI_FETCH_LAST,
this might save some time. So if you had a record set of 10000 rows and you set the buffer to 5000 and did a OCI_FETCH_LAST one would fetch the first 5000 rows into the buffer then the next 5000 rows.
If one requires only the first few rows there is no need to set a large prefetch value.

If the ora_prefetch_memory less than 1 or not present then memory size is not included in computing the
number of rows to prefetch otherwise the number of rows will be limited to memory size. Likewise if the RowCacheSize is less than 1 it
is not included in the computing of the prefetch rows.

=head1 ORACLE-SPECIFIC STATEMENT HANDLE METHODS

=head2 B<ora_stmt_type>

Returns the OCI Statement Type number for the SQL of a statement handle.

=head2 B<ora_stmt_type_name>

Returns the OCI Statement Type name for the SQL of a statement handle.

=head1 DBI STATEMENT HANDLE OBJECT METHODS

=head2 B<bind_param>

  $rv = $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value);
  $rv = $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value, $bind_type);
  $rv = $sth->bind_param($param_num, $bind_value, \%attr);

Allows the user to bind a value and/or a data type to a placeholder.

The value of C<$param_num> is a number if using the '?' or if using ":foo" style placeholders, the complete name
(e.g. ":foo") must be given.
The C<$bind_value> argument is fairly self-explanatory. A value of C<undef> will
bind a C<NULL> to the placeholder. Using C<undef> is useful when you want
to change just the type and will be overwriting the value later.
(Any value is actually usable, but C<undef> is easy and efficient).

The C<\%attr> hash is used to indicate the data type of the placeholder.
The default value is "varchar". If you need something else, you must
use one of the values provided by DBI or by DBD::Oracle. To use a SQL value,
modify your "use DBI" statement at the top of your script as follows:

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);

This will import some constants into your script. You can plug those
directly into the L</bind_param> call. Some common ones that you will
encounter are:

  SQL_INTEGER

To use Oracle SQL data types, import the list of values like this:

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

You can then set the data types by setting the value of the C<ora_type>
key in the hash passed to L</bind_param>.
The current list of Oracle data types exported is:

  ORA_VARCHAR2 ORA_STRING ORA_NUMBER ORA_LONG ORA_ROWID ORA_DATE ORA_RAW
  ORA_LONGRAW ORA_CHAR ORA_CHARZ ORA_MLSLABEL ORA_XMLTYPE ORA_CLOB ORA_BLOB
  ORA_RSET ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE ORA_NUMBER_TABLE SQLT_INT SQLT_FLT ORA_OCI
  SQLT_CHR SQLT_BIN

Data types are "sticky," in that once a data type is set to a certain placeholder,
it will remain for that placeholder, unless it is explicitly set to something
else afterwards. If the statement has already been prepared, and you switch the
data type to something else, DBD::Oracle will re-prepare the statement for you before
doing the next execute.

Examples:

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

  $SQL = "SELECT id FROM ptable WHERE size > ? AND title = ?";
  $sth = $dbh->prepare($SQL);

  ## Both arguments below are bound to placeholders as "varchar"
  $sth->execute(123, "Merk");

  ## Reset the datatype for the first placeholder to an integer
  $sth->bind_param(1, undef, SQL_INTEGER);

  ## The "undef" bound above is not used, since we supply params to execute
  $sth->execute(123, "Merk");

  ## Set the first placeholder's value and data type
  $sth->bind_param(1, 234, { pg_type => ORA_NUMBER });

  ## Set the second placeholder's value and data type.
  ## We don't send a third argument, so the default "varchar" is used
  $sth->bind_param('$2', "Zool");

  ## We realize that the wrong data type was set above, so we change it:
  $sth->bind_param('$1', 234, { pg_type => SQL_INTEGER });

  ## We also got the wrong value, so we change that as well.
  ## Because the data type is sticky, we don't need to change it
  $sth->bind_param(1, 567);

  ## This executes the statement with 567 (integer) and "Zool" (varchar)
  $sth->execute();

These attributes may be used in the C<\%attr> parameter of the
L<DBI/bind_param> or L<DBI/bind_param_inout> statement handle methods.

=over 4

=item ora_type

Specify the placeholder's datatype using an Oracle datatype.
A fatal error is raised if C<ora_type> and the DBI C<TYPE> attribute
are used for the same placeholder.
Some of these types are not supported by the current version of
DBD::Oracle and will cause a fatal error if used.
Constants for the Oracle datatypes may be imported using

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

Potentially useful values when DBD::Oracle was built using OCI 7 and later:

  ORA_VARCHAR2, ORA_STRING, ORA_LONG, ORA_RAW, ORA_LONGRAW,
  ORA_CHAR, ORA_MLSLABEL, ORA_RSET

Additional values when DBD::Oracle was built using OCI 8 and later:

  ORA_CLOB, ORA_BLOB, ORA_XMLTYPE, ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE, ORA_NUMBER_TABLE

Additional values when DBD::Oracle was built using OCI 9.2 and later:

  SQLT_CHR, SQLT_BIN

See L</Binding Cursors> for the correct way to use ORA_RSET.

See L</LOBS AND LONGS> for how to use ORA_CLOB and ORA_BLOB.

See L</SYS.DBMS_SQL datatypes> for ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE, ORA_NUMBER_TABLE.

See L</Data Interface for Persistent LOBs> for the correct way to use SQLT_CHR and SQLT_BIN.

See L</OTHER DATA TYPES> for more information.

See also L<DBI/Placeholders and Bind Values>.

=item ora_csform

Specify the OCI_ATTR_CHARSET_FORM for the bind value. Valid values
are SQLCS_IMPLICIT (1) and SQLCS_NCHAR (2). Both those constants can
be imported from the DBD::Oracle module. Rarely needed.

=item ora_csid

Specify the I<integer> OCI_ATTR_CHARSET_ID for the bind value.
Character set names can't be used currently.

=item ora_maxdata_size

Specify the integer OCI_ATTR_MAXDATA_SIZE for the bind value.
May be needed if a character set conversion from client to server
causes the data to use more space and so fail with a truncation error.

=item ora_maxarray_numentries

Specify the maximum number of array entries to allocate. Used with
ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE, ORA_NUMBER_TABLE. Define the maximum number of
array entries Oracle can pass back to you in OUT variable of type
TABLE OF ... .

=item ora_internal_type

Specify internal data representation. Currently is supported only for
ORA_NUMBER_TABLE.

=back

=head3 Optimizing Results

=head4 Prepare Postponed Till Execute

The DBD::Oracle module can avoid an explicit 'describe' operation
prior to the execution of the statement unless the application requests
information about the results (such as $sth->{NAME}). This reduces
communication with the server and increases performance (reducing the
number of PARSE_CALLS inside the server).

However, it also means that SQL errors are not detected until
C<execute()> (or $sth->{NAME} etc) is called instead of when
C<prepare()> is called. Note that if the describe is triggered by the
use of $sth->{NAME} or a similar attribute and the describe fails then
I<an exception is thrown> even if C<RaiseError> is false!

Set L</ora_check_sql> to 0 in prepare() to enable this behaviour.

=head2 B<bind_param_inout>

  $rv = $sth->bind_param_inout($param_num, \$scalar, 0);

DBD::Oracle fully supports bind_param_inout below are some uses for this method.

=head3 B<Returning A Value from an INSERT>

Oracle supports an extended SQL insert syntax which will return one
or more of the values inserted. This can be particularly useful for
single-pass insertion of values with re-used sequence values
(avoiding a separate "select seq.nextval from dual" step).

  $sth = $dbh->prepare(qq{
      INSERT INTO foo (id, bar)
      VALUES (foo_id_seq.nextval, :bar)
      RETURNING id INTO :id
  });
  $sth->bind_param(":bar", 42);
  $sth->bind_param_inout(":id", \my $new_id, 99);
  $sth->execute;
  print "The id of the new record is $new_id\n";

If you have many columns to bind you can use code like this:

  @params = (... column values for record to be inserted ...);
  $sth->bind_param($_, $params[$_-1]) for (1..@params);
  $sth->bind_param_inout(@params+1, \my $new_id, 99);
  $sth->execute;

If you have many rows to insert you can take advantage of Oracle's built in execute array feature
with code like this:

  my @in_values=('1',2,'3','4',5,'6',7,'8',9,'10');
  my @out_values;
  my @status;
  my $sth = $dbh->prepare(qq{
        INSERT INTO foo (id, bar)
        VALUES (foo_id_seq.nextval, ?)
        RETURNING id INTO ?
  });
  $sth->bind_param_array(1,\@in_values);
  $sth->bind_param_inout_array(2,\@out_values,0,{ora_type => ORA_VARCHAR2});
  $sth->execute_array({ArrayTupleStatus=>\@status}) or die "error inserting";
  foreach my $id (@out_values){
        print 'returned id='.$id.'\n';
  }

Which will return all the ids into @out_values.

=over

=item B<Note:>

=item This will only work for numbered (?) placeholders,

=item The third parameter of bind_param_inout_array, (0 in the example), "maxlen" is required by DBI but not used by DBD::Oracle

=item The "ora_type" attribute is not needed but only ORA_VARCHAR2 will work.

=back

=head3 Returning A Recordset

DBD::Oracle does not currently support binding a PL/SQL table (aka array)
as an IN OUT parameter to any Perl data structure.  You cannot therefore call
a PL/SQL function or procedure from DBI that uses a non-atomic datatype as
either a parameter, or a return value.  However, if you are using Oracle 9.0.1
or later, you can make use of table (or pipelined) functions.

For example, assume you have the existing PL/SQL Package :

  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Array_Example AS
    --
    TYPE tRec IS RECORD (
        Col1    NUMBER,
        Col2    VARCHAR2 (10),
        Col3    DATE) ;
    --
    TYPE taRec IS TABLE OF tRec INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER ;
    --
    FUNCTION Array_Func RETURN taRec ;
    --
  END Array_Example ;

  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Array_Example AS
  --
  FUNCTION Array_Func RETURN taRec AS
  --
    l_Ret       taRec ;
  --
  BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1 .. 5 LOOP
        l_Ret (i).Col1 := i ;
        l_Ret (i).Col2 := 'Row : ' || i ;
        l_Ret (i).Col3 := TRUNC (SYSDATE) + i ;
    END LOOP ;
    RETURN l_Ret ;
  END ;
  --
  END Array_Example ;

Currently, there is no way to directly call the function
Array_Example.Array_Func from DBI.  However, by making the following relatively
painless additions, its not only possible, but extremely efficient.

First, you need to create database object types that correspond to the record
and table types in the package.  From the above example, these would be :

  CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE tArray_Example__taRec
  AS OBJECT (
      Col1    NUMBER,
      Col2    VARCHAR2 (10),
      Col3    DATE
  ) ;

  CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE taArray_Example__taRec
  AS TABLE OF tArray_Example__taRec ;

Now, assuming the existing function needs to remain unchanged (it is probably
being called from other PL/SQL code), we need to add a new function to the
package.  Here's the new package specification and body :

  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Array_Example AS
      --
      TYPE tRec IS RECORD (
          Col1    NUMBER,
          Col2    VARCHAR2 (10),
          Col3    DATE) ;
      --
      TYPE taRec IS TABLE OF tRec INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER ;
      --
      FUNCTION Array_Func RETURN taRec ;
      FUNCTION Array_Func_DBI RETURN taArray_Example__taRec PIPELINED ;
      --
  END Array_Example ;

  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Array_Example AS
  --
  FUNCTION Array_Func RETURN taRec AS
      l_Ret  taRec ;
  BEGIN
      FOR i IN 1 .. 5 LOOP
          l_Ret (i).Col1 := i ;
          l_Ret (i).Col2 := 'Row : ' || i ;
          l_Ret (i).Col3 := TRUNC (SYSDATE) + i ;
      END LOOP ;
      RETURN l_Ret ;
  END ;

  FUNCTION Array_Func_DBI RETURN taArray_Example__taRec PIPELINED AS
      l_Set  taRec ;
  BEGIN
      l_Set := Array_Func ;
      FOR i IN l_Set.FIRST .. l_Set.LAST LOOP
          PIPE ROW (
              tArray_Example__taRec (
                 l_Set (i).Col1,
                 l_Set (i).Col2,
                 l_Set (i).Col3
              )
          ) ;
      END LOOP ;
      RETURN ;
  END ;
  --
  END Array_Example ;

As you can see, the new function is very simple.  Now, it is a simple matter
of calling the function as a straight-forward SELECT from your DBI code.  From
the above example, the code would look something like this :

  my $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM TABLE(Array_Example.Array_Func_DBI)');
  $sth->execute;
  while ( my ($col1, $col2, $col3) = $sth->fetchrow_array {
    ...
  }

=head3 B<SYS.DBMS_SQL datatypes>

DBD::Oracle has built-in support for B<SYS.DBMS_SQL.VARCHAR2_TABLE>
and B<SYS.DBMS_SQL.NUMBER_TABLE> datatypes. The simple example is here:

    my $statement='
    DECLARE
            tbl       SYS.DBMS_SQL.VARCHAR2_TABLE;
    BEGIN
            tbl := :mytable;
            :cc := tbl.count();
            tbl(1) := \'def\';
            tbl(2) := \'ijk\';
            :mytable := tbl;
    END;
    ';

    my $sth=$dbh->prepare( $statement );

    my @arr=( "abc","efg","hij" );

    $sth->bind_param_inout(":mytable", \\@arr, 10, {
            ora_type => ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE,
            ora_maxarray_numentries => 100
    } ) ;
    $sth->bind_param_inout(":cc", \$cc, 100  );
    $sth->execute();
    print        "Result: cc=",$cc,"\n",
            "\tarr=",Data::Dumper::Dumper(\@arr),"\n";

=item B<Note:>

=item Take careful note that we use '\\@arr' here because  the 'bind_param_inout'
   will only take a reference to a scalar.

=head3 B<ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE>

SYS.DBMS_SQL.VARCHAR2_TABLE object is always bound to array reference.
( in bind_param() and bind_param_inout() ). When you bind array, you need
to specify full buffer size for OUT data. So, there are two parameters:
I<max_len> (specified as 3rd argument of bind_param_inout() ),
and I<ora_maxarray_numentries>. They define maximum array entry length and
maximum rows, that can be passed to Oracle and back to you. In this
example we send array with 1 element with length=3, but allocate space for 100
Oracle array entries with maximum length 10 of each. So, you can get no more
than 100 array entries with length <= 10.

If you set I<max_len> to zero, maximum array entry length is calculated
as maximum length of entry of array bound. If 0 < I<max_len> < length( $some_element ),
truncation occur.

If you set I<ora_maxarray_numentries> to zero, current (at bind time) bound
array length is used as maximum. If 0 < I<ora_maxarray_numentries> < scalar(@array),
not all array entries are bound.

=head3 B<ORA_NUMBER_TABLE>

SYS.DBMS_SQL.NUMBER_TABLE object handling is much alike ORA_VARCHAR2_TABLE.
The main difference is internal data representation. Currently 2 types of
bind is allowed : as C-integer, or as C-double type. To select one of them,
you may specify additional bind parameter I<ora_internal_type> as either
B<SQLT_INT> or B<SQLT_FLT> for C-integer and C-double types.
Integer size is architecture-specific and is usually 32 or 64 bit.
Double is standard IEEE 754 type.

I<ora_internal_type> defaults to double (SQLT_FLT).

I<max_len> is ignored for OCI_NUMBER_TABLE.

Currently, you cannot bind full native Oracle NUMBER(38). If you really need,
send request to dbi-dev list.

The usage example is here:

    $statement='
    DECLARE
            tbl     SYS.DBMS_SQL.NUMBER_TABLE;
    BEGIN
            tbl := :mytable;
            :cc := tbl(2);
            tbl(4) := -1;
            tbl(5) := -2;
            :mytable := tbl;
    END;
    ';

    $sth=$dbh->prepare( $statement );

    if( ! defined($sth) ){
            die "Prepare error: ",$dbh->errstr,"\n";
    }

    @arr=( 1,"2E0","3.5" );

    # note, that ora_internal_type defaults to SQLT_FLT for ORA_NUMBER_TABLE .
    if( not $sth->bind_param_inout(":mytable", \\@arr, 10, {
                    ora_type => ORA_NUMBER_TABLE,
                    ora_maxarray_numentries => (scalar(@arr)+2),
                    ora_internal_type => SQLT_FLT
              } ) ){
            die "bind :mytable error: ",$dbh->errstr,"\n";
    }
    $cc=undef;
    if( not $sth->bind_param_inout(":cc", \$cc, 100 ) ){
            die "bind :cc error: ",$dbh->errstr,"\n";
    }

    if( not $sth->execute() ){
            die "Execute failed: ",$dbh->errstr,"\n";
    }
    print   "Result: cc=",$cc,"\n",
            "\tarr=",Data::Dumper::Dumper(\@arr),"\n";

The result is like:

    Result: cc=2
            arr=$VAR1 = [
              '1',
              '2',
              '3.5',
              '-1',
              '-2'
            ];

If you change bind type to B<SQLT_INT>, like:

    ora_internal_type => SQLT_INT

you get:

    Result: cc=2
            arr=$VAR1 = [
              1,
              2,
              3,
              -1,
              -2
            ];

=head2 B<bind_param_inout_array>

DBD::Oracle supports this undocumented feature of DBI. See L</Returning A Value from an INSERT> for an example.

=head2 B<bind_param_array>

  $rv = $sth->bind_param_array($param_num, $array_ref_or_value)
  $rv = $sth->bind_param_array($param_num, $array_ref_or_value, $bind_type)
  $rv = $sth->bind_param_array($param_num, $array_ref_or_value, \%attr)

Binds an array of values to a placeholder, so that each is used in turn by a call
to the L</execute_array> method.

=head2 B<execute>

  $rv = $sth->execute(@bind_values);

Perform whatever processing is necessary to execute the prepared statement.

=head2 B<execute_array>

  $tuples = $sth->execute_array() or die $sth->errstr;
  $tuples = $sth->execute_array(\%attr) or die $sth->errstr;
  $tuples = $sth->execute_array(\%attr, @bind_values) or die $sth->errstr;

  ($tuples, $rows) = $sth->execute_array(\%attr) or die $sth->errstr;
  ($tuples, $rows) = $sth->execute_array(\%attr, @bind_values) or die $sth->errstr;

Execute a prepared statement once for each item in a passed-in hashref, or items that
were previously bound via the L</bind_param_array> method. See the DBI documentation
for more details.

DBD::Oracle takes full advantage of OCI's array interface so inserts and updates using this interface will run very
quickly.

=head2 B<execute_for_fetch>

  $tuples = $sth->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub);
  $tuples = $sth->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status);

  ($tuples, $rows) = $sth->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub);
  ($tuples, $rows) = $sth->execute_for_fetch($fetch_tuple_sub, \@tuple_status);

Used internally by the L</execute_array> method, and rarely used directly. See the
DBI documentation for more details.

=head2 B<fetchrow_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref;

Fetches the next row of data from the statement handle, and returns a reference to an array
