=head1 NAME

DBD::File - Base class for writing file based DBI drivers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is a base class for writing other L<DBD|DBI::DBD>s.
It is not intended to function as a DBD itself (though it is possible).
If you want to access flat files, use L<DBD::AnyData|DBD::AnyData>, or
L<DBD::CSV|DBD::CSV> (both of which are subclasses of DBD::File).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The DBD::File module is not a true L<DBI|DBI> driver, but an abstract
base class for deriving concrete DBI drivers from it. The implication
is, that these drivers work with plain files, for example CSV files or
INI files. The module is based on the L<SQL::Statement|SQL::Statement>
module, a simple SQL engine.

See L<DBI|DBI> for details on DBI, L<SQL::Statement|SQL::Statement> for
details on SQL::Statement and L<DBD::CSV|DBD::CSV>, L<DBD::DBM|DBD::DBM>
or L<DBD::AnyData|DBD::AnyData> for example drivers.

=head2 Metadata

The following attributes are handled by DBI itself and not by DBD::File,
thus they all work as expected:

    Active
    ActiveKids
    CachedKids
    CompatMode             (Not used)
    InactiveDestroy
    AutoInactiveDestroy
    Kids
    PrintError
    RaiseError
    Warn                   (Not used)

=head3 The following DBI attributes are handled by DBD::File:

=head4 AutoCommit

Always on.

=head4 ChopBlanks

Works.

=head4 NUM_OF_FIELDS

Valid after C<< $sth->execute >>.

=head4 NUM_OF_PARAMS

Valid after C<< $sth->prepare >>.

=head4 NAME

Valid after C<< $sth->execute >>; undef for Non-Select statements.

=head4 NULLABLE

Not really working, always returns an array ref of ones, except the
affected table has been created in this session.  Valid after
C<< $sth->execute >>; undef for non-select statements.

=head3 Unsupported DBI attributes and methods

=over 2

=item bind_param_inout

=item CursorName

=item LongReadLen

=item LongTruncOk

=back

=head3 DBD::File specific attributes

In addition to the DBI attributes, you can use the following dbh
attributes:

=head4 f_dir

This attribute is used for setting the directory where the files are
opened and it defaults to the current directory (F<.>). Usually you set
it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table (see L<f_meta>).

When the value for C<f_dir> is a relative path, it is converted into
the appropriate absolute path name (based on the current working
directory) when the dbh attribute is set.

  f_dir => "/data/foo/csv",

If C<f_dir> is set to a non-existing location, the connection will fail.
See CVE-2014-10401 for reasoning. Because of this, folders to use cannot
be created after the connection, but must exist before the connection is
initiated.

See L<KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS>.

=head4 f_dir_search

This optional attribute can be set to pass a list of folders to also
find existing tables. It will B<not> be used to create new files.

  f_dir_search => [ "/data/bar/csv", "/dump/blargh/data" ],

=head4 f_ext

This attribute is used for setting the file extension. The format is:

  extension{/flag}

where the /flag is optional and the extension is case-insensitive.
C<f_ext> allows you to specify an extension which:

  f_ext => ".csv/r",

=over

=item *

makes DBD::File prefer F<table.extension> over F<table>.

=item *

makes the table name the filename minus the extension.

=back

    DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv

In the above example and when C<f_dir> contains both F<table.csv> and
F<table>, DBD::File will open F<table.csv> and the table will be
named "table". If F<table.csv> does not exist but F<table> does
that file is opened and the table is also called "table".

If C<f_ext> is not specified and F<table.csv> exists it will be opened
and the table will be called "table.csv" which is probably not what
you want.

NOTE: even though extensions are case-insensitive, table names are
not.

    DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv/r

The C<r> flag means the file extension is required and any filename
that does not match the extension is ignored.

Usually you set it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table
(see L<f_meta>).

=head4 f_schema

This will set the schema name and defaults to the owner of the
directory in which the table file resides. You can set C<f_schema> to
C<undef>.

    my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:CSV:", "", "", {
        f_schema => undef,
        f_dir    => "data",
        f_ext    => ".csv/r",
        }) or die $DBI::errstr;

By setting the schema you affect the results from the tables call:

    my @tables = $dbh->tables ();

    # no f_schema
    "merijn".foo
    "merijn".bar

    # f_schema => "dbi"
    "dbi".foo
    "dbi".bar

    # f_schema => undef
    foo
    bar

Defining C<f_schema> to the empty string is equal to setting it to C<undef>
so the DSN can be C<"dbi:CSV:f_schema=;f_dir=.">.

=head4 f_lock

The C<f_lock> attribute is used to set the locking mode on the opened
table files. Note that not all platforms support locking.  By default,
tables are opened with a shared lock for reading, and with an
exclusive lock for writing. The supported modes are:

  0: No locking at all.

  1: Shared locks will be used.

  2: Exclusive locks will be used.

But see L<KNOWN BUGS|/"KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"> below.

=head4 f_lockfile

If you wish to use a lockfile extension other than C<.lck>, simply specify
the C<f_lockfile> attribute:

  $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=.foo");
  $dbh->{f_lockfile} = ".foo";
  $dbh->{dbm_tables}{qux}{f_lockfile} = ".foo";

If you wish to disable locking, set the C<f_lockfile> to C<0>.

  $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=0");
  $dbh->{f_lockfile} = 0;
  $dbh->{dbm_tables}{qux}{f_lockfile} = 0;

=head4 f_encoding

With this attribute, you can set the encoding in which the file is opened.
This is implemented using C<< binmode $fh, ":encoding(<f_encoding>)" >>.

=head4 f_meta

Private data area aliasing L<DBI::DBD::SqlEngine/sql_meta> which
contains information about the tables this module handles. Table meta
data might not be available until the table has been accessed for the
first time e.g., by issuing a select on it however it is possible to
pre-initialize attributes for each table you use.

DBD::File recognizes the (public) attributes C<f_ext>, C<f_dir>,
C<f_file>, C<f_encoding>, C<f_lock>, C<f_lockfile>, C<f_schema>,
in addition to the attributes L<DBI::DBD::SqlEngine/sql_meta> already
supports. Be very careful when modifying attributes you do not know,
the consequence might be a destroyed or corrupted table.

C<f_file> is an attribute applicable to table meta data only and you
will not find a corresponding attribute in the dbh. Whilst it may be
reasonable to have several tables with the same column names, it is
not for the same file name. If you need access to the same file using
different table names, use C<SQL::Statement> as the SQL engine and the
C<AS> keyword:

    SELECT * FROM tbl AS t1, tbl AS t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id

C<f_file> can be an absolute path name or a relative path name but if
it is relative, it is interpreted as being relative to the C<f_dir>
attribute of the table meta data. When C<f_file> is set DBD::File will
use C<f_file> as specified and will not attempt to work out an
alternative for C<f_file> using the C<table name> and C<f_ext>
attribute.

While C<f_meta> is a private and readonly attribute (which means, you
cannot modify it's values), derived drivers might provide restricted
write access through another attribute. Well known accessors are
C<csv_tables> for L<DBD::CSV>, C<ad_tables> for L<DBD::AnyData> and
C<dbm_tables> for L<DBD::DBM>.

=head3 New opportunities for attributes from DBI::DBD::SqlEngine

=head4 sql_table_source

C<< $dbh->{sql_table_source} >> can be set to
I<DBD::File::TableSource::FileSystem> (and is the default setting
of DBD::File). This provides usual behaviour of previous DBD::File
releases on

  @ary = DBI->data_sources ($driver);
  @ary = DBI->data_sources ($driver, \%attr);

  @ary = $dbh->data_sources ();
  @ary = $dbh->data_sources (\%attr);

  @names = $dbh->tables ($catalog, $schema, $table, $type);

  $sth = $dbh->table_info ($catalog, $schema, $table, $type);
  $sth = $dbh->table_info ($catalog, $schema, $table, $type, \%attr);

  $dbh->func ("list_tables");

=head4 sql_data_source

C<< $dbh->{sql_data_source} >> can be set to either
I<DBD::File::DataSource::File>, which is default and provides the
well known behavior of DBD::File releases prior to 0.41, or
I<DBD::File::DataSource::Stream>, which reuses already opened
file-handle for operations.

=head3 Internally private attributes to deal with SQL backends

Do not modify any of these private attributes unless you understand
the implications of doing so. The behavior of DBD::File and derived
DBDs might be unpredictable when one or more of those attributes are
modified.

=head4 sql_nano_version

Contains the version of loaded DBI::SQL::Nano.

=head4 sql_statement_version

Contains the version of loaded SQL::Statement.

=head4 sql_handler

Contains either the text 'SQL::Statement' or 'DBI::SQL::Nano'.

=head4 sql_ram_tables

Contains optionally temporary tables.

=head4 sql_flags

Contains optional flags to instantiate the SQL::Parser parsing engine
when SQL::Statement is used as SQL engine. See L<SQL::Parser> for valid
flags.

=head2 Driver private methods

=head3 Default DBI methods

=head4 data_sources

The C<data_sources> method returns a list of subdirectories of the current
directory in the form "dbi:CSV:f_dir=$dirname".

If you want to read the subdirectories of another directory, use

    my ($drh)  = DBI->install_driver ("CSV");
    my (@list) = $drh->data_sources (f_dir => "/usr/local/csv_data");

=head3 Additional methods

The following methods are only available via their documented name when
DBD::File is used directly. Because this is only reasonable for testing
purposes, the real names must be used instead. Those names can be computed
by replacing the C<f_> in the method name with the driver prefix.

=head4 f_versions

Signature:

  sub f_versions (;$)
  {
    my ($table_name) = @_;
    $table_name ||= ".";
    ...
    }

Returns the versions of the driver, including the DBI version, the Perl
version, DBI::PurePerl version (if DBI::PurePerl is active) and the version
of the SQL engine in use.

    my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:File:");
    my $f_versions = $dbh->func ("f_versions");
    print "$f_versions\n";
    __END__
    # DBD::File              0.41 using IO::File (1.16)
    #   DBI::DBD::SqlEngine  0.05 using SQL::Statement 1.406
    # DBI                    1.623
    # OS                     darwin (12.2.1)
    # Perl                   5.017006 (darwin-thread-multi-ld-2level)

Called in list context, f_versions will return an array containing each
line as single entry.

Some drivers might use the optional (table name) argument and modify
version information related to the table (e.g. DBD::DBM provides storage
backend information for the requested table, when it has a table name).

=head1 KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item *

This module uses flock () internally but flock is not available on all
platforms. On MacOS and Windows 95 there is no locking at all (perhaps
not so important on MacOS and Windows 95, as there is only a single
user).

=item *

The module stores details about the handled tables in a private area
of the driver handle (C<$drh>). This data area is not shared between
different driver instances, so several C<< DBI->connect () >> calls will
cause different table instances and private data areas.

This data area is filled for the first time when a table is accessed,
either via an SQL statement or via C<table_info> and is not
destroyed until the table is dropped or the driver handle is released.
Manual destruction is possible via L<f_clear_meta>.

The following attributes are preserved in the data area and will
evaluated instead of driver globals:

=over 8

=item f_ext

=item f_dir

=item f_dir_search

=item f_lock

=item f_lockfile

=item f_encoding

=item f_schema

=item col_names

=item sql_identifier_case

=back

The following attributes are preserved in the data area only and
cannot be set globally.

=over 8

=item f_file

=back

The following attributes are preserved in the data area only and are
computed when initializing the data area:

=over 8

=item f_fqfn

=item f_fqbn

=item f_fqln

=item table_name

=back

For DBD::CSV tables this means, once opened "foo.csv" as table named "foo",
another table named "foo" accessing the file "foo.txt" cannot be opened.
Accessing "foo" will always access the file "foo.csv" in memorized
C<f_dir>, locking C<f_lockfile> via memorized C<f_lock>.

You can use L<f_clear_meta> or the C<f_file> attribute for a specific table
to work around this.

=item *

When used with SQL::Statement and temporary tables e.g.,

  CREATE TEMP TABLE ...

the table data processing bypasses DBD::File::Table. No file system
calls will be made and there are no clashes with existing (file based)
tables with the same name. Temporary tables are chosen over file
tables, but they will not covered by C<table_info>.

=head1 NAME

DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base - Base class for DBD::Gofer policies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=...", ...)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBD::Gofer can be configured via a 'policy' mechanism that allows you to
fine-tune the number of round-trips to the Gofer server.  The policies are
grouped into classes (which may be subclassed) and referenced by the name of
the class.

The L<DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base> class is the base class for all the policy
classes and describes all the individual policy items.

The Base policy is not used directly. You should use a policy class derived from it.

=head1 POLICY CLASSES

Three policy classes are supplied with DBD::Gofer:

L<DBD::Gofer::Policy::pedantic> is most 'transparent' but slowest because it
makes more  round-trips to the Gofer server.

L<DBD::Gofer::Policy::classic> is a reasonable compromise - it's the default policy.

L<DBD::Gofer::Policy::rush> is fastest, but may require code changes in your applications.

Generally the default C<classic> policy is fine. When first testing an existing
application with Gofer it is a good idea to start with the C<pedantic> policy
first and then switch to C<classic> or a custom policy, for final testing.

=head1 POLICY ITEMS

These are temporary docs: See the source code for list of policies and their defaults.

In a future version the policies and their defaults will be defined in the pod and parsed out at load-time.

See the source code to this module for more details.

=head1 POLICY CUSTOMIZATION

XXX This area of DBD::Gofer is subject to change.

There are three ways to customize policies:

Policy classes are designed to influence the overall behaviour of DBD::Gofer
with existing, unaltered programs, so they work in a reasonably optimal way
without requiring code changes. You can implement new policy classes as
subclasses of existing policies.

In many cases individual policy items can be overridden on a case-by-case basis
within your application code. You do this by passing a corresponding
C<<go_<policy_name>>> attribute into DBI methods by your application code.
This lets you fine-tune the behaviour for special cases.

The policy items are implemented as methods. In many cases the methods are
passed parameters relating to the DBD::Gofer code being executed. This means
the policy can implement dynamic behaviour that varies depending on the
particular circumstances, such as the particular statement being executed.

DBD::Gofer::Policy::classic - The 'classic' policy for DBD::Gofer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=classic", ...)

The C<classic> policy is the default DBD::Gofer policy, so need not be included in the DSN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBD::Gofer::Policy::pedantic - The 'pedantic' policy for DBD::Gofer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=pedantic", ...)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<pedantic> policy tries to be as transparent as possible. To do this it
makes round-trips to the server for almost every DBI method call.

This is the best policy to use when first testing existing code with Gofer.
Once it's working well you should consider moving to the C<classic> policy or defining your own policy class.

Temporary docs: See the source code for list of policies and their defaults.

In a future version the policies and their defaults will be defined in the pod and parsed out at load-time.
