   command was run from a subdirectory.

 * Some codepaths in "git diff" used regexec(3) on a buffer that was
   mmap(2)ed, which may not have a terminating NUL, leading to a read
   beyond the end of the mapped region.  This was fixed by introducing
   a regexec_buf() helper that takes a <ptr,len> pair with REG_STARTEND
   extension.

 * The procedure to build Git on Mac OS X for Travis CI hardcoded the
   internal directory structure we assumed HomeBrew uses, which was a
   no-no.  The procedure has been updated to ask HomeBrew things we
   need to know to fix this.

 * When "git rebase -i" is given a broken instruction, it told the
   user to fix it with "--edit-todo", but didn't say what the step
   after that was (i.e. "--continue").

 * Documentation around tools to import from CVS was fairly outdated.

 * "git clone --recurse-submodules" lost the progress eye-candy in
   a recent update, which has been corrected.

 * A low-level function verify_packfile() was meant to show errors
   that were detected without dying itself, but under some conditions
   it didn't and died instead, which has been fixed.

 * When "git fetch" tries to find where the history of the repository
   it runs in has diverged from what the other side has, it has a
   mechanism to avoid digging too deep into irrelevant side branches.
   This however did not work well over the "smart-http" transport due
   to a design bug, which has been fixed.

 * In the codepath that comes up with the hostname to be used in an
   e-mail when the user didn't tell us, we looked at the ai_canonname
   field in struct addrinfo without making sure it is not NULL first.

 * "git worktree", even though it used the default_abbrev setting that
   ought to be affected by the core.abbrev configuration variable, ignored
   the variable setting.  The command has been taught to read the
   default set of configuration variables to correct this.

 * "git init" tried to record core.worktree in the repository's
   'config' file when the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable was set and
   it was different from where GIT_DIR appears as ".git" at its top,
   but the logic was faulty when .git is a "gitdir:" file that points
   at the real place, causing trouble in working trees that are
   managed by "git worktree".  This has been corrected.

 * Codepaths that read from an on-disk loose object were too loose in
   validating that they are reading a proper object file and
   sometimes read past the data they read from the disk, which has
   been corrected.  H/t to Gustavo Grieco for reporting.

 * The original command line syntax for "git merge", which was "git
   merge <msg> HEAD <parent>...", has been deprecated for quite some
   time, and "git gui" was the last in-tree user of the syntax.  This
   is finally fixed, so that we can move forward with the deprecation.

 * An author name that has a backslash-quoted double quote in the
   human readable part ("My \"double quoted\" name"), was not unquoted
   correctly while applying a patch from a piece of e-mail.

 * Doc update to clarify what "log -3 --reverse" does.

 * Almost everybody uses DEFAULT_ABBREV to refer to the default
   setting for the abbreviation, but "git blame" peeked into
   underlying variable bypassing the macro for no good reason.

 * The "graph" API used in "git log --graph" miscounted the number of
   output columns consumed so far when drawing a padding line, which
   has been fixed; this did not affect any existing code as nobody
   tried to write anything after the padding on such a line, though.

 * The code that parses the format parameter of the for-each-ref command
   has seen a micro-optimization.

 * When we started to use cURL to talk to an imap server, we forgot to explicitly add
   imap(s):// before the destination.  To some folks, that didn't work
   and the library tried to make HTTP(s) requests instead.

 * The ./configure script generated from configure.ac was taught how
   to detect support of SSL by libcurl better.

 * The command-line completion script (in contrib/) learned to
   complete "git cmd ^mas<HT>" to complete the negative end of
   reference to "git cmd ^master".
   (merge 49416ad22a cp/completion-negative-refs later to maint).

 * The existing "git fetch --depth=<n>" option was hard to use
   correctly when making the history of an existing shallow clone
   deeper.  A new option, "--deepen=<n>", has been added to make this
   easier to use.  "git clone" also learned "--shallow-since=<date>"
   and "--shallow-exclude=<tag>" options to make it easier to specify
   "I am interested only in the recent N months worth of history" and
   "Give me only the history since that version".
   (merge cccf74e2da nd/shallow-deepen later to maint).

 * "git blame --reverse OLD path" is now DWIMmed to show how lines
   in path in an old revision OLD have survived up to the current
   commit.
   (merge e1d09701a4 jc/blame-reverse later to maint).

 * The http.emptyauth configuration variable is a way to allow an empty username to
   pass when attempting to authenticate using mechanisms like
   Kerberos.  We took an unspecified (NULL) username and sent ":"
   (i.e. no username, no password) to CURLOPT_USERPWD, but did not do
   the same when the username is explicitly set to an empty string.

 * "git clone" of a local repository can be done at the filesystem
   level, but the codepath did not check errors while copying and
   adjusting the file that lists alternate object stores.

 * Documentation for "git commit" was updated to clarify that "commit
   -p <paths>" adds to the current contents of the index to come up
   with what to commit.

 * A stray symbolic link in the $GIT_DIR/refs/ directory could make name
   resolution loop forever, which has been corrected.

 * The "submodule.<name>.path" stored in .gitmodules is never copied
   to .git/config and such a key in .git/config has no meaning, but
   the documentation described it next to submodule.<name>.url
   as if both belong to .git/config.  This has been fixed.

 * In a worktree created via "git
   worktree", "git checkout" attempts to protect users from confusion
   by refusing to check out a branch that is already checked out in
   another worktree.  However, this also prevented checking out a
   branch which is designated as the primary branch of a bare
   repository, in a worktree that is connected to the bare
   repository.  The check has been corrected to allow it.

 * "git rebase" immediately after "git clone" failed to find the fork
   point from the upstream.

 * When fetching from a remote that has many tags that are irrelevant
   to branches we are following, we used to waste way too many cycles
   checking if the object pointed at by a tag (that we are not
   going to fetch!) exists in our repository too carefully.

 * Protect our code from over-eager compilers.

 * Recent git allows submodule.<name>.branch to use a special token
   "." instead of the branch name; the documentation has been updated
   to describe it.

 * "git send-email" attempts to pick up valid e-mails from the
   trailers, but people in the real world write non-addresses there, like
   "Cc: Stable <add@re.ss> # 4.8+", which broke the output depending
   on the availability and vintage of the Mail::Address perl module.
   (merge dcfafc5214 mm/send-email-cc-cruft-after-address later to maint).

 * The Travis CI configuration we ship ran the tests with the --verbose
   option but this risks non-TAP output that happens to be "ok" to be
   misinterpreted as TAP signalling a test that passed.  This resulted
   in unnecessary failures.  This has been corrected by introducing a
   new mode to run our tests in the test harness to send the verbose
   output separately to the log file.

 * Some AsciiDoc formatters mishandle a displayed illustration with
   tabs in it.  Adjust a few of them in merge-base documentation to
   work around them.

 * Fixed a minor regression in "git submodule" that was introduced
   when more helper functions were reimplemented in C.
   (merge 77b63ac31e sb/submodule-ignore-trailing-slash later to maint).

 * The code that we have used for the past 10+ years to cycle
   4-element ring buffers turns out to be not quite portable in
   theoretical world.
   (merge bb84735c80 rs/ring-buffer-wraparound later to maint).

 * "git daemon" used fixed-length buffers to turn URLs to the
   repository the client asked for into the server side directory
   paths, using snprintf() to avoid overflowing these buffers, but
   allowed possibly truncated paths to the directory.  This has been
   tightened to reject such a request that causes an overlong path to be
   served.
   (merge 6bdb0083be jk/daemon-path-ok-check-truncation later to maint).

 * Recent update to git-sh-setup (a library of shell functions that
   are used by our in-tree scripted Porcelain commands) included
   another shell library git-sh-i18n without specifying where it is,
   relying on the $PATH.  This has been fixed to be more explicit by
   prefixing with $(git --exec-path) output.
   (merge 1073094f30 ak/sh-setup-dot-source-i18n-fix later to maint).

 * Fix for a racy false-positive test failure.
   (merge fdf4f6c79b as/merge-attr-sleep later to maint).

 * Portability update and workaround for builds on recent Mac OS X.
   (merge a296bc0132 ls/macos-update later to maint).

 * Using a %(HEAD) placeholder in "for-each-ref --format=" option
   caused the command to segfault when on an unborn branch.
   (merge 84679d470d jc/for-each-ref-head-segfault-fix later to maint).

 * "git rebase -i" did not work well with the core.commentchar
   configuration variable for two reasons, both of which have been
   fixed.
   (merge 882cd23777 js/rebase-i-commentchar-fix later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.

=========================

Fixes since v2.11
-----------------

 * The default Travis-CI configuration specifies newer P4 and GitLFS.

 * The character width table has been updated to match Unicode 9.0

 * Update the isatty() emulation for Windows by updating the previous
   hack that depended on internals of (older) MSVC runtime.

 * "git rev-parse --symbolic" failed with a more recent notation like
   "HEAD^-1" and "HEAD^!".

 * An empty directory in a working tree that can simply be nuked used
   to interfere while merging or cherry-picking a change to create a
   submodule directory there, which has been fixed..

 * The code in "git push" to compute if any commit being pushed in the
   superproject binds a commit in a submodule that hasn't been pushed
   out was overly inefficient, making it unusable even for a small
   project that does not have any submodule but have a reasonable
   number of refs.

 * "git push --dry-run --recurse-submodule=on-demand" wasn't
   "--dry-run" in the submodules.

 * The output from "git worktree list" was made in readdir() order,
   and was unstable.

 * mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode configuration variable did not apply
   to built-in tools, but now it does.

 * "git p4" LFS support was broken when LFS stores an empty blob.

 * Fix a corner case in merge-recursive regression that crept in
   during 2.10 development cycle.

 * Update the error messages from the dumb-http client when it fails
   to obtain loose objects; we used to give sensible error message
   only upon 404 but we now forbid unexpected redirects that needs to
   be reported with something sensible.

 * When diff.renames configuration is on (and with Git 2.9 and later,
   it is enabled by default, which made it worse), "git stash"
   misbehaved if a file is removed and another file with a very
   similar content is added.

 * "git diff --no-index" did not take "--no-abbrev" option.

 * "git difftool --dir-diff" had a minor regression when started from
   a subdirectory, which has been fixed.

 * "git commit --allow-empty --only" (no pathspec) with dirty index
   ought to be an acceptable way to create a new commit that does not
   change any paths, but it was forbidden, perhaps because nobody
   needed it so far.

 * A pathname that begins with "//" or "\\" on Windows is special but
   path normalization logic was unaware of it.

 * "git pull --rebase", when there is no new commits on our side since
   we forked from the upstream, should be able to fast-forward without
   invoking "git rebase", but it didn't.

 * The way to specify hotkeys to "xxdiff" that is used by "git
   mergetool" has been modernized to match recent versions of xxdiff.

 * Unlike "git am --abort", "git cherry-pick --abort" moved HEAD back
   to where cherry-pick started while picking multiple changes, when
   the cherry-pick stopped to ask for help from the user, and the user
   did "git reset --hard" to a different commit in order to re-attempt
   the operation.

 * Code cleanup in shallow boundary computation.

 * A recent update to receive-pack to make it easier to drop garbage
   objects made it clear that GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES cannot
   have a pathname with a colon in it (no surprise!), and this in turn
   made it impossible to push into a repository at such a path.  This
   has been fixed by introducing a quoting mechanism used when
   appending such a path to the colon-separated list.

 * The function usage_msg_opt() has been updated to say "fatal:"
   before the custom message programs give, when they want to die
   with a message about wrong command line options followed by the
   standard usage string.

 * "git index-pack --stdin" needs an access to an existing repository,
   but "git index-pack file.pack" to generate an .idx file that
   corresponds to a packfile does not.

 * Fix for NDEBUG builds.

 * A lazy "git push" without refspec did not internally use a fully
   specified refspec to perform 'current', 'simple', or 'upstream'
   push, causing unnecessary "ambiguous ref" errors.

 * "git p4" misbehaved when swapping a directory and a symbolic link.

 * Even though an fix was attempted in Git 2.9.3 days, but running
   "git difftool --dir-diff" from a subdirectory never worked. This
   has been fixed.

 * "git p4" that tracks multiple p4 paths imported a single changelist
   that touches files in these multiple paths as one commit, followed
   by many empty commits.  This has been fixed.

 * A potential but unlikely buffer overflow in Windows port has been
   fixed.

 * When the http server gives an incomplete response to a smart-http
   rpc call, it could lead to client waiting for a full response that
   will never come.  Teach the client side to notice this condition
   and abort the transfer.

 * Some platforms no longer understand "latin-1" that is still seen in
   the wild in e-mail headers; replace them with "iso-8859-1" that is
   more widely known when conversion fails from/to it.

 * Update the procedure to generate "tags" for developer support.

 * Update the definition of the MacOSX test environment used by
   TravisCI.

 * A few git-svn updates.

 * Compression setting for producing packfiles were spread across
   three codepaths, one of which did not honor any configuration.
   Unify these so that all of them honor core.compression and
   pack.compression variables the same way.

 * "git fast-import" sometimes mishandled while rebalancing notes
   tree, which has been fixed.

 * Recent update to the default abbreviation length that auto-scales
   lacked documentation update, which has been corrected.

 * Leakage of lockfiles in the config subsystem has been fixed.

 * It is natural that "git gc --auto" may not attempt to pack
   everything into a single pack, and there is no point in warning
   when the user has configured the system to use the pack bitmap,
   leading to disabling further "gc".

 * "git archive" did not read the standard configuration files, and
   failed to notice a file that is marked as binary via the userdiff
   driver configuration.

 * "git blame --porcelain" misidentified the "previous" <commit, path>
   pair (aka "source") when contents came from two or more files.

 * "git rebase -i" with a recent update started showing an incorrect
   count when squashing more than 10 commits.

 * "git <cmd> @{push}" on a detached HEAD used to segfault; it has
   been corrected to error out with a message.

 * Tighten a test to avoid mistaking an extended ERE regexp engine as
   a PRE regexp engine.

 * Typing ^C to pager, which usually does not kill it, killed Git and
   took the pager down as a collateral damage in certain process-tree
   structure.  This has been fixed.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.

=========================

Fixes since v2.11.1
-------------------

 * "git-shell" rejects a request to serve a repository whose name
   begins with a dash, which makes it no longer possible to get it
   confused into spawning service programs like "git-upload-pack" with
   an option like "--help", which in turn would spawn an interactive
   pager, instead of working with the repository user asked to access
   (i.e. the one whose name is "--help").

=========================

Fixes since v2.11.3
-------------------

 * "git cvsserver" no longer is invoked by "git daemon" by default,
   as it is old and largely unmaintained.

 * Various Perl scripts did not use safe_pipe_capture() instead of
   backticks, leaving them susceptible to end-user input.  They have
   been corrected.

Credits go to joernchen <joernchen@phenoelit.de> for finding the
unsafe constructs in "git cvsserver", and to Jeff King at GitHub for
finding and fixing instances of the same issue in other scripts.

======================

Backward compatibility notes.

 * Use of an empty string that is used for 'everything matches' is
   still warned and Git asks users to use a more explicit '.' for that
   instead.  The hope is that existing users will not mind this
   change, and eventually the warning can be turned into a hard error,
   upgrading the deprecation into removal of this (mis)feature.  That
   is not scheduled to happen in the upcoming release (yet).

 * The historical argument order "git merge <msg> HEAD <commit>..."
   has been deprecated for quite some time, and will be removed in a
   future release.

 * An ancient script "git relink" has been removed.


Updates since v2.11
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Various updates to "git p4".

 * "git p4" didn't interact with the internal of .git directory
   correctly in the modern "git-worktree"-enabled world.

 * "git branch --list" and friends learned "--ignore-case" option to
   optionally sort branches and tags case insensitively.

 * In addition to %(subject), %(body), "log --pretty=format:..."
   learned a new placeholder %(trailers).

 * "git rebase" learned "--quit" option, which allows a user to
   remove the metadata left by an earlier "git rebase" that was
   manually aborted without using "git rebase --abort".

 * "git clone --reference $there --recurse-submodules $super" has been
   taught to guess repositories usable as references for submodules of
   $super that are embedded in $there while making a clone of the
   superproject borrow objects from $there; extend the mechanism to
   also allow submodules of these submodules to borrow repositories
   embedded in these clones of the submodules embedded in the clone of
   the superproject.

 * Porcelain scripts written in Perl are getting internationalized.

 * "git merge --continue" has been added as a synonym to "git commit"
   to conclude a merge that has stopped due to conflicts.

 * Finer-grained control of what protocols are allowed for transports
   during clone/fetch/push have been enabled via a new configuration
   mechanism.

 * "git shortlog" learned "--committer" option to group commits by
   committer, instead of author.

 * GitLFS integration with "git p4" has been updated.

 * The isatty() emulation for Windows has been updated to eradicate
   the previous hack that depended on internals of (older) MSVC
   runtime.

 * Some platforms no longer understand "latin-1" that is still seen in
   the wild in e-mail headers; replace them with "iso-8859-1" that is
   more widely known when conversion fails from/to it.

 * "git grep" has been taught to optionally recurse into submodules.

 * "git rm" used to refuse to remove a submodule when it has its own
   git repository embedded in its working tree.  It learned to move
   the repository away to $GIT_DIR/modules/ of the superproject
   instead, and allow the submodule to be deleted (as long as there
   will be no loss of local modifications, that is).

 * A recent updates to "git p4" was not usable for older p4 but it
   could be made to work with minimum changes.  Do so.

 * "git diff" learned diff.interHunkContext configuration variable
   that gives the default value for its --inter-hunk-context option.

 * The prereleaseSuffix feature of version comparison that is used in
   "git tag -l" did not correctly when two or more prereleases for the
   same release were present (e.g. when 2.0, 2.0-beta1, and 2.0-beta2
   are there and the code needs to compare 2.0-beta1 and 2.0-beta2).

 * "git submodule push" learned "--recurse-submodules=only option to
   push submodules out without pushing the top-level superproject.

 * "git tag" and "git verify-tag" learned to put GPG verification
   status in their "--format=<placeholders>" output format.

 * An ancient repository conversion tool left in contrib/ has been
   removed.

 * "git show-ref HEAD" used with "--verify" because the user is not
   interested in seeing refs/remotes/origin/HEAD, and used with
   "--head" because the user does not want HEAD to be filtered out,
   i.e. "git show-ref --head --verify HEAD", did not work as expected.

 * "git submodule add" used to be confused and refused to add a
   locally created repository; users can now use "--force" option
   to add them.
   (merge 619acfc78c sb/submodule-add-force later to maint).

 * Some people feel the default set of colors used by "git log --graph"
   rather limiting.  A mechanism to customize the set of colors has
   been introduced.

 * "git read-tree" and its underlying unpack_trees() machinery learned
   to report problematic paths prefixed with the --super-prefix option.

 * When a submodule "A", which has another submodule "B" nested within
   it, is "absorbed" into the top-level superproject, the inner
   submodule "B" used to be left in a strange state.  The logic to
   adjust the .git pointers in these submodules has been corrected.

 * The user can specify a custom update method that is run when
   "submodule update" updates an already checked out submodule.  This
   was ignored when checking the submodule out for the first time and
   we instead always just checked out the commit that is bound to the
   path in the superproject's index.

 * The command line completion (in contrib/) learned that
   "git diff --submodule=" can take "diff" as a recently added option.

 * The "core.logAllRefUpdates" that used to be boolean has been
   enhanced to take 'always' as well, to record ref updates to refs
   other than the ones that are expected to be updated (i.e. branches,
   remote-tracking branches and notes).

 * Comes with more command line completion (in contrib/) for recently
   introduced options.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Commands that operate on a log message and add lines to the trailer
   blocks, such as "format-patch -s", "cherry-pick (-x|-s)", and
   "commit -s", have been taught to use the logic of and share the
   code with "git interpret-trailer".

 * The default Travis-CI configuration specifies newer P4 and GitLFS.

 * The "fast hash" that had disastrous performance issues in some
   corner cases has been retired from the internal diff.

 * The character width table has been updated to match Unicode 9.0

 * Update the procedure to generate "tags" for developer support.

 * The codeflow of setting NOATIME and CLOEXEC on file descriptors Git
   opens has been simplified.

 * "git diff" and its family had two experimental heuristics to shift
   the contents of a hunk to make the patch easier to read.  One of
   them turns out to be better than the other, so leave only the
   "--indent-heuristic" option and remove the other one.

 * A new submodule helper "git submodule embedgitdirs" to make it
   easier to move embedded .git/ directory for submodules in a
   superproject to .git/modules/ (and point the latter with the former
   that is turned into a "gitdir:" file) has been added.

 * "git push \\server\share\dir" has recently regressed and then
   fixed.  A test has retroactively been added for this breakage.

 * Build updates for Cygwin.

 * The implementation of "real_path()" was to go there with chdir(2)
   and call getcwd(3), but this obviously wouldn't be usable in a
   threaded environment.  Rewrite it to manually resolve relative
   paths including symbolic links in path components.

 * Adjust documentation to help AsciiDoctor render better while not
   breaking the rendering done by AsciiDoc.

 * The sequencer machinery has been further enhanced so that a later
   set of patches can start using it to reimplement "rebase -i".

 * Update the definition of the MacOSX test environment used by
   TravisCI.

 * Rewrite a scripted porcelain "git difftool" in C.

 * "make -C t failed" will now run only the tests that failed in the
   previous run.  This is usable only when prove is not use, and gives
   a useless error message when run after "make clean", but otherwise
   is serviceable.

 * "uchar [40]" to "struct object_id" conversion continues.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.

Fixes since v2.10
-----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.9 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * We often decide if a session is interactive by checking if the
   standard I/O streams are connected to a TTY, but isatty() that
   comes with Windows incorrectly returned true if it is used on NUL
   (i.e. an equivalent to /dev/null).  This has been fixed.

 * "git svn" did not work well with path components that are "0", and
   some configuration variable it uses were not documented.

 * "git rev-parse --symbolic" failed with a more recent notation like
   "HEAD^-1" and "HEAD^!".

 * An empty directory in a working tree that can simply be nuked used
   to interfere while merging or cherry-picking a change to create a
   submodule directory there, which has been fixed..

 * The code in "git push" to compute if any commit being pushed in the
   superproject binds a commit in a submodule that hasn't been pushed
   out was overly inefficient, making it unusable even for a small
   project that does not have any submodule but have a reasonable
   number of refs.

 * "git push --dry-run --recurse-submodule=on-demand" wasn't
   "--dry-run" in the submodules.

 * The output from "git worktree list" was made in readdir() order,
   and was unstable.

 * mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode configuration variable did not apply
   to built-in tools, but now it does.

 * "git p4" LFS support was broken when LFS stores an empty blob.

 * A corner case in merge-recursive regression that crept in
   during 2.10 development cycle has been fixed.

 * Transport with dumb http can be fooled into following foreign URLs
   that the end user does not intend to, especially with the server
   side redirects and http-alternates mechanism, which can lead to
   security issues.  Tighten the redirection and make it more obvious
   to the end user when it happens.

 * Update the error messages from the dumb-http client when it fails
   to obtain loose objects; we used to give sensible error message
   only upon 404 but we now forbid unexpected redirects that needs to
   be reported with something sensible.

 * When diff.renames configuration is on (and with Git 2.9 and later,
   it is enabled by default, which made it worse), "git stash"
   misbehaved if a file is removed and another file with a very
   similar content is added.

 * "git diff --no-index" did not take "--no-abbrev" option.

 * "git difftool --dir-diff" had a minor regression when started from
   a subdirectory, which has been fixed.

 * "git commit --allow-empty --only" (no pathspec) with dirty index
   ought to be an acceptable way to create a new commit that does not
   change any paths, but it was forbidden, perhaps because nobody
   needed it so far.

 * Git 2.11 had a minor regression in "merge --ff-only" that competed
   with another process that simultaneously attempted to update the
   index. We used to explain what went wrong with an error message,
   but the new code silently failed.  The error message has been
   resurrected.

 * A pathname that begins with "//" or "\\" on Windows is special but
   path normalization logic was unaware of it.

 * "git pull --rebase", when there is no new commits on our side since
   we forked from the upstream, should be able to fast-forward without
   invoking "git rebase", but it didn't.

 * The way to specify hotkeys to "xxdiff" that is used by "git
   mergetool" has been modernized to match recent versions of xxdiff.

 * Unlike "git am --abort", "git cherry-pick --abort" moved HEAD back
   to where cherry-pick started while picking multiple changes, when
   the cherry-pick stopped to ask for help from the user, and the user
   did "git reset --hard" to a different commit in order to re-attempt
   the operation.

 * Code cleanup in shallow boundary computation.

 * A recent update to receive-pack to make it easier to drop garbage
   objects made it clear that GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES cannot
   have a pathname with a colon in it (no surprise!), and this in turn
   made it impossible to push into a repository at such a path.  This
   has been fixed by introducing a quoting mechanism used when
   appending such a path to the colon-separated list.

 * The function usage_msg_opt() has been updated to say "fatal:"
   before the custom message programs give, when they want to die
   with a message about wrong command line options followed by the
   standard usage string.

 * "git index-pack --stdin" needs an access to an existing repository,
   but "git index-pack file.pack" to generate an .idx file that
   corresponds to a packfile does not.

 * Fix for NDEBUG builds.

 * A lazy "git push" without refspec did not internally use a fully
   specified refspec to perform 'current', 'simple', or 'upstream'
   push, causing unnecessary "ambiguous ref" errors.

 * "git p4" misbehaved when swapping a directory and a symbolic link.

 * Even though an fix was attempted in Git 2.9.3 days, but running
   "git difftool --dir-diff" from a subdirectory never worked. This
   has been fixed.

 * "git p4" that tracks multiple p4 paths imported a single changelist
   that touches files in these multiple paths as one commit, followed
   by many empty commits.  This has been fixed.

 * A potential but unlikely buffer overflow in Windows port has been
   fixed.

 * When the http server gives an incomplete response to a smart-http
   rpc call, it could lead to client waiting for a full response that
   will never come.  Teach the client side to notice this condition
   and abort the transfer.

 * Compression setting for producing packfiles were spread across
   three codepaths, one of which did not honor any configuration.
   Unify these so that all of them honor core.compression and
   pack.compression variables the same way.

 * "git fast-import" sometimes mishandled while rebalancing notes
   tree, which has been fixed.

 * Recent update to the default abbreviation length that auto-scales
   lacked documentation update, which has been corrected.

 * Leakage of lockfiles in the config subsystem has been fixed.

 * It is natural that "git gc --auto" may not attempt to pack
   everything into a single pack, and there is no point in warning
   when the user has configured the system to use the pack bitmap,
   leading to disabling further "gc".

 * "git archive" did not read the standard configuration files, and
   failed to notice a file that is marked as binary via the userdiff
   driver configuration.

 * "git blame --porcelain" misidentified the "previous" <commit, path>
   pair (aka "source") when contents came from two or more files.

 * "git rebase -i" with a recent update started showing an incorrect
   count when squashing more than 10 commits.

 * "git <cmd> @{push}" on a detached HEAD used to segfault; it has
   been corrected to error out with a message.

 * Running "git add a/b" when "a" is a submodule correctly errored
   out, but without a meaningful error message.
   (merge 2d81c48fa7 sb/pathspec-errors later to maint).

 * Typing ^C to pager, which usually does not kill it, killed Git and
   took the pager down as a collateral damage in certain process-tree
   structure.  This has been fixed.

 * "git mergetool" without any pathspec on the command line that is
   run from a subdirectory became no-op in Git v2.11 by mistake, which
   has been fixed.

 * Retire long unused/unmaintained gitview from the contrib/ area.
   (merge 3120925c25 sb/remove-gitview later to maint).

 * Tighten a test to avoid mistaking an extended ERE regexp engine as
   a PRE regexp engine.

 * An error message with an ASCII control character like '\r' in it
   can alter the message to hide its early part, which is problematic
   when a remote side gives such an error message that the local side
   will relay with a "remote: " prefix.
   (merge f290089879 jk/vreport-sanitize later to maint).

 * "git fsck" inspects loose objects more carefully now.
   (merge cce044df7f jk/loose-object-fsck later to maint).

 * A crashing bug introduced in v2.11 timeframe has been found (it is
   triggerable only in fast-import) and fixed.
   (merge abd5a00268 jk/clear-delta-base-cache-fix later to maint).

 * With an anticipatory tweak for remotes defined in ~/.gitconfig
   (e.g. "remote.origin.prune" set to true, even though there may or
   may not actually be "origin" remote defined in a particular Git
   repository), "git remote rename" and other commands misinterpreted
   and behaved as if such a non-existing remote actually existed.
   (merge e459b073fb js/remote-rename-with-half-configured-remote later to maint).

 * A few codepaths had to rely on a global variable when sorting
   elements of an array because sort(3) API does not allow extra data
   to be passed to the comparison function.  Use qsort_s() when
   natively available, and a fallback implementation of it when not,
   to eliminate the need, which is a prerequisite for making the
   codepath reentrant.

 * "git fsck --connectivity-check" was not working at all.
   (merge a2b22854bd jk/fsck-connectivity-check-fix later to maint).

 * After starting "git rebase -i", which first opens the user's editor
   to edit the series of patches to apply, but before saving the
   contents of that file, "git status" failed to show the current
   state (i.e. you are in an interactive rebase session, but you have
   applied no steps yet) correctly.
   (merge df9ded4984 js/status-pre-rebase-i later to maint).

 * Test tweak for FreeBSD where /usr/bin/unzip is unsuitable to run
   our tests but /usr/local/bin/unzip is usable.
   (merge d98b2c5fce js/unzip-in-usr-bin-workaround later to maint).

 * "git p4" did not work well with multiple git-p4.mapUser entries on
   Windows.
   (merge c3c2b05776 gv/mingw-p4-mapuser later to maint).

 * "git help" enumerates executable files in $PATH; the implementation
   of "is this file executable?" on Windows has been optimized.
   (merge c755015f79 hv/mingw-help-is-executable later to maint).

 * Test tweaks for those who have default ACL in their git source tree
   that interfere with the umask test.
   (merge d549d21307 mm/reset-facl-before-umask-test later to maint).

 * Names of the various hook scripts must be spelled exactly, but on
   Windows, an .exe binary must be named with .exe suffix; notice
   $GIT_DIR/hooks/<hookname>.exe as a valid <hookname> hook.
   (merge 235be51fbe js/mingw-hooks-with-exe-suffix later to maint).

 * Asciidoctor, an alternative reimplementation of AsciiDoc, still
   needs some changes to work with documents meant to be formatted
   with AsciiDoc.  "make USE_ASCIIDOCTOR=YesPlease" to use it out of
   the box to document our pages is getting closer to reality.

 * Correct command line completion (in contrib/) on "git svn"
   (merge 2cbad17642 ew/complete-svn-authorship-options later to maint).

 * Incorrect usage help message for "git worktree prune" has been fixed.
   (merge 2488dcab22 ps/worktree-prune-help-fix later to maint).

 * Adjust a perf test to new world order where commands that do
   require a repository are really strict about having a repository.
   (merge c86000c1a7 rs/p5302-create-repositories-before-tests later to maint).

 * "git log --graph" did not work well with "--name-only", even though
   other forms of "diff" output were handled correctly.
   (merge f5022b5fed jk/log-graph-name-only later to maint).

 * The push-options given via the "--push-options" option were not
   passed through to external remote helpers such as "smart HTTP" that
   are invoked via the transport helper.

 * The documentation explained what "git stash" does to the working
   tree (after stashing away the local changes) in terms of "reset
   --hard", which was exposing an unnecessary implementation detail.
   (merge 20a7e06172 tg/stash-doc-cleanup later to maint).

 * When "git p4" imports changelist that removes paths, it failed to
   convert pathnames when the p4 used encoding different from the one
   used on the Git side.  This has been corrected.
   (merge a8b05162e8 ls/p4-path-encoding later to maint).

 * A new coccinelle rule that catches a check of !pointer before the
   pointer is free(3)d, which most likely is a bug.
   (merge ec6cd14c7a rs/cocci-check-free-only-null later to maint).

 * "ls-files" run with pathspec has been micro-optimized to avoid
   having to memmove(3) unnecessary bytes.
   (merge 96f6d3f61a rs/ls-files-partial-optim later to maint).

 * A hotfix for a topic already in 'master'.
   (merge a4d92d579f js/mingw-isatty later to maint).

 * Other minor doc, test and build updates and code cleanups.
   (merge f2627d9b19 sb/submodule-config-cleanup later to maint).

=========================

Fixes since v2.12
-----------------

 * Reduce authentication round-trip over HTTP when the server supports
   just a single authentication method.  This also improves the
   behaviour when Git is misconfigured to enable http.emptyAuth
   against a server that does not authenticate without a username
   (i.e. not using Kerberos etc., which makes http.emptyAuth
   pointless).

 * Windows port wants to use OpenSSL's implementation of SHA-1
   routines, so let them.

 * Add 32-bit Linux variant to the set of platforms to be tested with
   Travis CI.

 * When a redirected http transport gets an error during the
   redirected request, we ignored the error we got from the server,
   and ended up giving a not-so-useful error message.

 * The patch subcommand of "git add -i" was meant to have paths
   selection prompt just like other subcommand, unlike "git add -p"
   directly jumps to hunk selection.  Recently, this was broken and
   "add -i" lost the paths selection dialog, but it now has been
   fixed.

 * Git v2.12 was shipped with an embarrassing breakage where various
   operations that verify paths given from the user stopped dying when
   seeing an issue, and instead later triggering segfault.

 * The code to parse "git log -L..." command line was buggy when there
   are many ranges specified with -L; overrun of the allocated buffer
   has been fixed.

 * The command-line parsing of "git log -L" copied internal data
   structures using incorrect size on ILP32 systems.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.

=========================

Fixes since v2.12.1
-------------------

 * "git status --porcelain" is supposed to give a stable output, but a
   few strings were left as translatable by mistake.

 * "Dumb http" transport used to misparse a nonsense http-alternates
   response, which has been fixed.

 * "git diff --quiet" relies on the size field in diff_filespec to be
   correctly populated, but diff_populate_filespec() helper function
   made an incorrect short-cut when asked only to populate the size
   field for paths that need to go through convert_to_git() (e.g. CRLF
   conversion).

 * There is no need for Python only to give a few messages to the
   standard error stream, but we somehow did.

 * A leak in a codepath to read from a packed object in (rare) cases
   has been plugged.

 * "git upload-pack", which is a counter-part of "git fetch", did not
   report a request for a ref that was not advertised as invalid.
   This is generally not a problem (because "git fetch" will stop
   before making such a request), but is the right thing to do.

 * A "gc.log" file left by a backgrounded "gc --auto" disables further
   automatic gc; it has been taught to run at least once a day (by
   default) by ignoring a stale "gc.log" file that is too old.

 * "git remote rm X", when a branch has remote X configured as the
   value of its branch.*.remote, tried to remove branch.*.remote and
   branch.*.merge and failed if either is unset.

 * A caller of tempfile API that uses stdio interface to write to
   files may ignore errors while writing, which is detected when
   tempfile is closed (with a call to ferror()).  By that time, the
   original errno that may have told us what went wrong is likely to
   be long gone and was overwritten by an irrelevant value.
   close_tempfile() now resets errno to EIO to make errno at least
   predictable.
