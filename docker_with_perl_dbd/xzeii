to get working executables, and their explanations shed much light on
the issues.

Waldemar's build is described in L<Appendix A>, and Michael's is
described in L<Appendix C>.

While I have not reproduced either of these configurations, I believe
the information is complete enough (particularly in the aggregate) to
be helpful to others who might wish to replicate it.

=head2 The "default" built in compiler 64bit build (/usr/bin/cc)

And now, at long last, we have a recipe for building perl and DBD-Oracle
using the default bundled C compiler.  Please see the L<Appendix B> build
instructions provided by Gram Ludlow, using the default /usr/bin/cc
bundled compiler. Please note that perl itself will I<NOT> build using
that compiler.

=head2 Configure (doing it manually)

Once you have downloaded and unpacked the Perl sources (version 5.8.8
assumed here), you must configure Perl.  For those of you new to building
Perl from source, the Configure program will ask you a series of
questions about how to build Perl.  You may supply default answers to the
questions when you invoke the Configure program by command line flags.

We want to build a Perl that understands large files (over 2GB, which is
the default for building perl on HP-UX), and that is incompatible with
v5.005 Perl scripts (compiling with v5.005 compatibility causes mod_perl
to complain about malloc pollution).  At the command prompt type:

    cd perl-5.8.8
    sh ./Configure -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' -des

or, if you need a 64bit build

    sh ./Configure -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' -Duse64bitall -des

Do not forget the trailing space inside the single quotes. This is also
described by H.Merijn Brand in the README.hpux from the perl core
distribution.

When asked:

    Any additional cc flags? - Answer by prepending: I<+Z> to enable
    position independent code.

    For example:
    Any additional cc flags? [-D_HP-UX_SOURCE -Aa] -Ae +Z -z

Though this should be the default in more recent perl versions.

Lastly, and this is optional, when asked:

    Do you want to install Perl as /usr/bin/perl? [y] n

    You may or may not want to install directly in /usr/bin/perl,
    many persons on HP install Perl in /opt/perl<version>/bin/perl and
    put a symbolic link to /usr/bin/perl.  Furthermore, you can supply
    the answer to this question by adding an additional switch to the
    invocation of Configure such as: Configure -Dprefix=/opt/perl

After you have answered the above questions, accept the default values
for all of the remaining questions.  You may press <Enter> for each
remaining question, or you may enter "& -d" (good idea) at the next
question and the Configure will go into auto-pilot and use the Perl
supplied defaults.

BTW: If you add -lcl and -lpthread to the end of the list it will not
work. I wasted a day and a half trying to figure out why I had lost the
recipe, before I realized that this was the problem. The symptom will
be that

   make test

of Perl itself will fail to load dynamic libraries.

You can check in the generated 'config.sh' that the options you selected
are correct.  If not, modify config.sh and then re-run ./Configure with
the '-d' option to process the config.sh file.

Build & Install

    make
    make test
    make install

If you are going to build mod_perl and Apache it has been suggested
that you modify Config.pm to the change the HP-UX ldflags & ccdlflags in
F</your/install/prefix/lib/5.6.0/PA-RISC2.0/Config.pm> as follows:

    ccdlflags=''
    cccdlflags='+Z'
    ldflags=' -L/usr/local/lib'

This is not necessary if you are not using mod_perl and Apache.

=head1 Build and Install DBI

    cd DBI-1.50
    Perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

=head1 Build and Install DBD-Oracle-1.07 and later

It is critical to setup your Oracle environmental variables.  Many people
do this incorrectly and spend days trying to get a working version of
DBD-Oracle.  Below are examples of a local database and a remote database
(i.e. the database is on a different machine than your Perl/DBI/DBD
installation) environmental variable setup.

Example (local database):

    export ORACLE_USERID=<validuser/validpasswd>
    export ORACLE_HOME=<path to oracle>
    export ORACLE_SID=<a valid instance>
    export SHLIB_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib       #for 32bit HP
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib  #for 64bit HP (I defined them both)

Note that HP-UX supports I<both> SHLIB_PATH I<and> LD_LIBRARY_PATH for
all libraries that need to be found, but that each library itself can
enable or disable any of the two, and can also set preference for the
order they are used, so please set them to the same value.

Example (remote database):

    export ORACLE_USERID=<validuser/validpasswd>
    export ORACLE_HOME=<path to oracle>
    export ORACLE_SID=@<valid tnsnames.ora entry>
    export SHLIB_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib       #for 32bit HP
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib  #for 64bit HP (I defined them both)

The standard mantra now works out of the box on HP-UX:

    cd DBD-Oracle-1.07  # or more recent version
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install        # if all went smoothly

And with DBD-1.14 and later the following can be used:

    cd DBD-Oracle-1.14  # or more recent version
    perl Makefile.PL -l # uses a simple link to oracle's main library
    make
    make test
    make install        # if all went smoothly

If you have trouble, see the L<Trouble Shooting> instructions below, for
hints of what might be wrong... and send me a note, describing your
configuration, and what you did to fix it.

=head1 Trouble Shooting

=head2 "Unresolved symbol"

In general, find the symbols, edit the Makefile, and make test.

You'll have to modify the recipe accordingly, in my case the symbol
"LhtStrCreate" was unresolved. (Authors Note: thanks patch suggestions
by Jay Strauss this situation which occurs with Oracle 8.1.6 should
now be handled in Makefile.PL.)

1) Find the symbols.

   a) The following ksh/bash code (courtesy of Roger) will search
      from $ORACLE_HOME and below for Symbols in files in lib directories.
      Save the following to a file called "findSymbol".

   >>>>  CUT HERE <<<<<
   cd $ORACLE_HOME

   echo "\nThis takes a while, grepping a lot of stuff"
   echo "   ignore the \"no symbols\" warnings\n"

   sym=$1; shift;
   libs="*.sl"

   for lib in  $(find . -name $libs -print); do
      if nm -p $lib | grep -q $sym; then
         echo "found \"$sym\" in $lib"
      fi
   done
   >>>>> CUT HERE <<<<

      Note that on Itanium machines (HP-UX 11.23), the shared libraries
      have a .so extension instead of the .sl HP-UX uses on PA-RISC.

   b) Run it (replace "LhtStrCreate" with your "Unresolved symbol").
      For example, at my installation, findSymbols produced the
      following output:

      # chmod 755 findSymbols
      # ./findSymbol LhtStrCreate

      found "LhtStrCreate" in ./lib/libagtsh.sl
      found "LhtStrCreate" in ./lib/libclntsh.sl
      found "LhtStrCreate" in ./lib/libwtc8.sl

2) Edit the Makefile

In the previous step your unresolved symbol was found in one or more
library files.  You will need to edit the OTHERLDFLAGS makefile macro,
and add the missing libraries.

When you add those library files to OTHERLDFLAGS you must convert the
name from the actual name to the notation that OTHERLDFLAGS uses.

      libclntsh.sl         becomes => -lclntsh
      libagtsh.sl          becomes => -lagtsh
      libwtc8.sl           becomes => -lwtc8

That is, you replace the "lib" in the name to "-l" and remove the ".sl"
(or the .so).

You can edit the Makefile in 2 ways:

   a) Do this:

      perl -pi -e's/\b(OTHERLDFLAGS.*$)/$1 -lclntsh/' Makefile

   b) Using vi, emacs... edit the file, find OTHERLDFLAGS, and add the
      above "-l" entries to the end of the line.

      For example the line:
      OTHERLDFLAGS =  -L/opt/oracle/product/8.1.6/lib/... -lqsmashr

      Becomes:
      OTHERLDFLAGS =  -L/opt/oracle/product/8.1.6/lib/... -lqsmashr -lclntsh

3) make test

Perform a make test, if symbols are still unresolved repeat the editing
of the Makefile and make test again.

=head1 DBD-Oracle-1.06

You are strongly urged to upgrade. However here is what you may need to
know to get it or work, if you insist on using an earlier version.

Check the output that above command produces, to verify that

   -Wl,+n
   -W1,+s

is b<NOT> present. and that

   -lqsmashr

B<is> present.

If the version of Makefile.PL does not include the patch produced at the
time of this document,  then the above conditions will likely not be
met.
You can fix this as follows:

    perl -pi -e's/-Wl,\+[sn]//' Makefile

=head1 Building on a Oracle Client Machine

If you need to build or deliver the DBD-Oracle interface on or to a
machine upon which the Oracle database has not been installed you need
take the following into consideration:

=over

=item 1) Oracle files are needed for DBD::Oracle to compile

=item 2) Oracle files are needed for the compiled DBD to connect

=item 3) ORACLE_HOME environment variable must be set

=item 4) SHLIB_PATH environment variable must be set

=back

=head2 Compiling on a Client Machine

This may seem obvious to some, but the Oracle software has to be present
to compile and run DBD-Oracle.  The best way to compile and install on a
client machine, is to use the oracle installer to install the oracle
(client) software locally.  Install SQL*Net, Pro*C and SQL*Plus.  After
this some tests with SQL*Net (tnsping at a minimum) are an good idea.
Make sure you can connect to your remote database, and everything works
with Oracle before you start bashing your head into the wall trying to
get DBD-Oracle to work.

If you do not have the Oracle installer handy, the following hack has
been known to work:

Either open an NFS share from the oracle installation directory on the
machine that has Oracle and point both of the above-mentioned env vars to
that share, or alternatively copy the following four directories from your
Oracle installation over to the machine on which you are compiling the DBD:

drwxr-xr-x   3 oracle   dba         3072 Jul  3 09:36 lib
drwxr-xr-x  13 oracle   dba          512 Jul  3 09:38 network
drwxr-xr-x   7 oracle   dba          512 Jul  2 19:25 plsql
drwxr-xr-x  12 oracle   dba          512 Jul  3 09:38 rdbms

then point the above-mentioned env vars to the containing directory (good
place to put them, if copying locally, might be /usr/lib/oracle,
/usr/local/lib/oracle, or /opt/oracle/lib )

In any case, the compiler needs to be able to find files in the above
four directories from Oracle in order to get all the source code needed
to compile properly.

=head2 Required Runtime environment

Again, use the Oracle installer to install the Oracle Client on the
machine where your scripts will be running.  If the Oracle installer is
not available, the following hack should suffice:

For running the compiled DBD in Perl and connecting, you need only the
files in the 'lib' folder mentioned above, either connecting to them
through an NFS share on the Oracle machine, or having copied them
directly onto the local machine, say, in /usr/lib/oracle . Make sure the
env variable for ORACLE_HOME = /usr/lib/oracle and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
includes /usr/lib/oracle .  You can set the env var in your perl script
by typing

    $ENV{ORACLE_HOME} = '/usr/lib/oracle';

=head1 Apache and mod_perl

B<Nota Bene:> these instructions are now more than a year and a half old,
you may have to tinker.

If you are not building this version of Perl for Apache you can go on to
build what ever other modules you require.  The following instructions
describe how these modules were built with the Perl/DBD-Oracle built
above: The following is what worked for Roger Foskett:

=head1 Apache Web server

    cd apache_1.3.14/
    LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT="" \
    LDFLAGS="-lm -lpthread -lcl" \
    CC=/usr/bin/cc \
    CFLAGS="-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" \
    ./configure \
        --prefix=/opt/www/apache \
        --enable-shared=max \
        --disable-rule=EXPAT \
        --enable-module=info \
        --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE

The Expat XML parser is disabled as it conflicts with the Perl XML-Parser
module causing core dumps.  -lcl is needed to ensure that Apache does not
coredump complaining about thread local storage

    make
    make install

Once installed, ensure that the generated httpd.conf is properly
configured, change the relevant lines to below (the default user/group
caused problems on HP (the user 'www' may need to be created)

        User www
        Group other
        port 80

=head2 mod_perl

    cd mod_perl-1.24_01/
    perl Makefile.PL \
        NO_HTTPD=1 \
        USE_APXS=1 \
        WITH_APXS=/opt/www/apache/bin/apxs \
        EVERYTHING=1
    make
    make install

=head2 htdig intranet search engine

    cd htdig-3.1.5/
    CC='cc' CPP='aCC' \
    ./configure \
        --prefix=/opt/www/htdig \

=head1 APPENDICES

=head2 Appendix A

(gcc build info from Waldemar Zurowski)

This is pretty much verbatim the build information I received from
Waldemar Zurowski on building Perl and DBD-Oracle using gcc on HP.  Note
that this build was on a PA-RISC1.1 machine.

=head3 Host

   HP-UX hostname B.11.11 U 9000/800 XXXXXXXXX unlimited-user license

=head3 Oracle

   Oracle 8.1.7

=head3 Parameters to build Perl

   ./Configure -des -Uinstallusrbinperl -Uusethreads -Uuseithreads
   -Duselargefiles -Dcc=gcc -Darchname=PA-RISC1.1 -Dprefix=/opt/perl-non-thread
   -Dlibs='-lcl -lpthread -L${ORACLE_HOME}/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads
   -ljava -lnsl -lnm -lndbm -ldld -lm -lc -lndir -lcrypt -lsec'

-L${ORACLE_HOME}/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads -ljava, was added
because DBD::Oracle wants to link with it (probably due to Oracle's own
build rules picked up by Makefile.PL)

Set environment variable LDOPTS to '+s' (see ld(1)). This holds extra
parameters to HP-UX's ld command, as I don't use GNU ld (does anybody?).
This allows you to build an executable, which when run would search for
dynamic linked libraries using SHLIB_PATH (for 32-bit executable) and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (for 64-bit executable). Obviously LDOPTS is needed only
when building Perl _and_ DBI + DBD::Oracle.

Then, after building Perl + DBI + DBD::Oracle and moving it into
production environment it was enough to add to SHLIB_PATH
${ORACLE_HOME}/lib and ${ORACLE_HOME}/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads,
for example:

SHLIB_PATH=${ORACLE_HOME}/lib:${ORACLE_HOME}/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads:
$SHLIB_PATH

Please note output of ldd command:

   $ ldd -s ./perl
    [...]
     find library=/home/ora817/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads/libjava.sl;
   required by ./perl
       search path=/home/ora817/lib:/home/ora817/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads
   (SHLIB_PATH)
       trying path=/home/ora817/lib/libjava.sl
       trying path=/home/ora817/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads/libjava.sl
           /home/ora817/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads/libjava.sl =>
   /home/ora817/JRE/lib/PA_RISC/native_threads/libjava.sl
    [...]

All of this mess is necessary because of weakness of shl_load(3X),
explained in this document and in some discussion forums at HP.com
site. I have learned, that HP issued patch PHSS_24304 for HP-UX 11.11
and PHSS_24303 for HP-UX 11.00, which introduced variable LD_PRELOAD.
I haven't tried it yet, but it seems promising that it would allow you
to completely avoid building your own Perl binary, as it would be enough
to set LD_PRELOAD to libjava.sl (for example) and all
'Cannot load XXXlibrary' during building of DBD::Oracle should be gone.

The documentation says, that setting this variable should have the same
effect as linking binary with this library. Also please note, that this
variable is used only when binary is not setuid nor setgid binary (for
obvious security reasons).

It seems, that the best way to find out if you already have this patch
applied, is to check if 'man 5 dld.sl' says anything about LD_PRELOAD
environment variable.

Best regards,

Waldemar Zurowski

Authors Note:  Search for references to LD_PRELOAD else where in this
document.  Using LD_PRELOAD is probably a fragile solution at best.
Better to do what Waldemar actually did, which is to include libjava in
the extra link options.

(64 bit build with /usr/bin/cc -- bundled C compiler)

Gram M. Ludlow writes:

I recently had a problem with Oracle 9 64-bit on HPUX 11i. We have
another application that required SH_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the 64-bit
libraries, which "broke" the Oraperl module. So I did some research and
successfully recompiled and re-installed with the most recent versions of
everything (perl, DBI, DBD) that works with 64-bit shared libraries. This
is the error we were getting (basically)
"/usr/lib/dld.sl: Bad magic number for shared library:
/ora1/app/oracle/product/9.2.0.1.0/lib32"

Here is my step-by-step instructions, pretty much what you have but
streamlined for this particular case.

Required software:

   HPUX 11.11 (11i) PA-RISC
   perl 5.8.4 source
   DBI-1.42 source
   DBD-Oracle-1.16 source
   Oracle 9.2.0.1.0 installation

=over

=item Step 1: Compiling Perl

This compiles PERL using the default HPUX cc compiler. The important
things to note here are the configure parameters. the only non-default
option to take is to add "+z" to the additional cc flags step.

   gunzip perl-5.8.4.tar.gz
   tar -xf perl-5.8.4.tar
   cd perl-5.8.4
   ./Configure -Ubincompat5005 -Duselargefiles -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' -Duse64bitall

Any additional cc flags?
Add +z to beginning of list, include all other options.

   make; make test

98% of tests should succeed. If less, something is wrong.

=item Step 2: DBI

   gunzip DBI-1.42.tar.gz
   tar -xvf DBI-1.42.tar
   cd DBI-1.42
   perl Makefile.PL
   make;make test
   make install

=item Step 3: Install DBD-Oracle

First, set the following environment variables specific you your Oracle
installation:

   export ORACLE_USERID=user/pass
   export ORACLE_HOME=/oracle/product/9.2.0.1.0
   export ORACLE_SID=orap1

Then unpack and build:

   gunzip DBD-Oracle-1.16.tar.gz
   tar -xvf DBD-Oracle-1.16.tar
   cd DBD-Oracle-1.16
   perl Makefile.PL -l
   make;make test
   make install

=back

Note from H.Merijn Brand: In more recent perl distributions using
HP C-ANSI-C should "just work" (TM), provided your C compiler can be
found and used, your database is up and running, and your environment
variables are set as noted. Example is for a 64bit build, as Oracle
ships Oracle 9 and up for HP-UX only in 64bit builds.

   gzip -d <perl-5.8.8.tgz | tar xf -
   cd perl-5.8.8
   sh ./Configure -Duse64bitall -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' -des
   make
   make test_harness
   make install

   gzip -d <DBI-1.50.tgz | tar xf -

Michael Schuh writes:

It was a bit by trial and error and a bit more by following your
suggestions (and mapping them to gcc) that I got something that worked.

One of the most significant "mappings" was to take your suggestion under
"Configure" to add "+Z" to the ccflags variable and to change that to
"-fPIC" (which, I learned from the gcc man page, is different than
"-fpic", which is the counterpart for +z). -fPIC (+Z) allows I<big>
offsets in the Position Independent Code, where -fpic (+z) only allows
small offsets.

I suspect that your hint about adding -lcl and -lpthread were crucial,
but (after doing so) I never encountered any problems that were related
to them.

One thing that I did was create a shell script to set some variables,
as the initial environment for root on the target system didn't work
very well.  Here is that script, trimmed to remove a bunch of echo
statements, etc.:

   # -------------------------------------------------------------------
   # root.env - sets some environment variables the way I want them...
   #
   # Mike Schuh, June 2002, July 2002

   export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc

   export INSTALL=./install-sh

   . appl_setup DDD

   export ORACLE_SID="SSS"
   export ORACLE_USERID="XXX/YYY"

   export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/perl5/bin:/usr/c
   ontrib/bin:/opt/nettladm/bin:/opt/fc/bin:/opt/fcms/bin:/opt/pd/bin:/usr/bin/X11:

   t/pred/bin:/opt/gnome/bin:/sbin

   # end of root.env

The appl_setup sets some Oracle variables (specific to our installation),
which I then override for the database that I am working on.  The script
(which I source) also uses some variables specific to other applications
(e.g., Tivoli), mostly to unclutter my debugging.  The INSTALL variable
is related to building libgdbm.

(Why Dynamic Linking)

Some one posted to the DBI email list the following question:

   What are the advantages of building a dynamically linked version?
   Being able to use threads? Or something besides that?

The answer is there are too many to count, but here are several big ones:

=over

=item 1 Much smaller executables

Only the code referenced gets loaded... this
means faster execution times, and less machine resources (VM) used)

=item 2 Modular addition and updating of modules.

This is HUGE.  One does not relink B<EVERYTHING, EVERY time> one changes
or updates  a module.

=item 3 It eliminates Dynaloader warning (multiply defined).

This occurs with the static build when Perl is run with -w.  I fixed
this by removing -w from my #! lines, converting the pragam "use
warnings;". However, it was annoying, since all my scripts had -w in the
#! line.

=item 4 It's the default build

Since almost every OS now supports dynamic linking, I believe that static
linking is NOT getting the same level of vetting it maybe used to.
Dynamically linking is what you get by default, so its way better tested.

=item 5 It's required for Apache and mod_perl.

Michael Fox reported a bug when you are using DBD-Oracle-1.18 or later and when using older Oracle versions.

To work around this problem, complete the following procedure:

=over

=item 1 Log in to your Oracle account:

   su - oracle

=item 2 In a text editor, open the following file:

   $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/shrept.lst

=item 3 Add the following line:

   rdbms:OCILobLocatorAssign

=item 4 (optional) Add the names of any other missing functions needed by applications, other than WebLogic Server 7.0, that you want to execute.
Note: The OCILobLocatorAssign function is not the only missing function that WebLogic Server 7.0 should be able to call, but it is the only missing function that WebLogic Server 7.0 requires. Other functions that WebLogic Server should be able to call, such as OCIEnvCreate and OCIerminate, are also missing. If these functions are required by other applications that you plan to run, you must add them to your environment by specifying them, too, in $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/shrept.lst.

=item 5 Rebuild the shared client library:

   $ cd $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/lib
   $ make -f ins_rdbms.mk client_sharedlib

The make command updates the following files in /opt/oracle/product/8.1.7/lib:

   clntsh.map
   ldap.def libclntsh.so
   libclntsh.so.8.0 libclntst8.a
   network.def
   plsql.def
   precomp.def
   rdbms.def

Because OCILobLocatorAssign is now visible in libclntsh.so, WebLogic Server can call it.

=head1 NAME

DBD::Oracle::Troubleshooting::Linux - Tips and Hints to Troubleshoot DBD::Oracle on Linux

=head1 VERSION

version 1.90

=head1 SELinux and httpd

If SELinux is running, it can prevents DBD::Oracle running in
an Apache process to load shared libraries it requires (libclntsh.so
or libnnz12.so). A typical symptom is a line like the following in
the Apache error logs:

    [Tue Apr 17 13:22:45 2012] [error] Can't load '.../DBD/Oracle/Oracle.so' for
    module DBD::Oracle: libnnz11.so: cannot enable executable stack as shared
    object requires: Permission denied at .../DynaLoader.pm line 190.\n at
    .../startup.pl line 17\nCompilation failed in require at ...

The fix:

    /usr/sbin/setsebool -P httpd_execmem

=head1 Installing with Instantclient .rpm files.

Nothing special with this you just have to set up you permissions as follows;

1) Have permission for RWE on '/usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.3/client/' or the other directory where you RPMed to

2) Set export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.3/client

3) Set export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib

4) If you plan to use tnsnames to connect to remote servers and your tnsnames.ora file is not in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin, you will need to Export TNS_ADMIN=dir to point DBD::Oracle to where your tnsnames.ora file is

=head1 undefined symbol: __cmpdi2 comes up when Oracle isn't properly linked to the libgcc.a library.

In version 8, this was corrected by changing the SYSLIBS entry in
$ORACLE_HOME/bin/genclntsh to include
"-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2 -lgcc".

I had tried this with no success as when this program was then run, the
error "unable to find libgcc" was generated.  Of course, this was the
library I was trying to describe!

It turns out that now it is necessary to edit the same file and append
"`gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`" (including the backquotes!).  If you do
this and then run "genclntsh", the libclntsh is properly generated and
the linkage with DBD::Oracle proceeds properly.

=head1 cc1: invalid option `tune=pentium4'" error

If you get the above it seems that either your Perl or OS where compiled with a different version of GCC or the GCC that is on your system is very old.

No real problem with the above however you will have to

1) run Perl Makefile.PL

2) edit the Makefile and remove the offending '-mtune=pentium4' text

3) save and exit

4) do the make install and it should work fine for you

=head1 Oracle 9i Lite

The advice is to use the regular Oracle9i not the lite version.

Another great source of help was: http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingOracle9i.html

just getting 9i and 9i lite installed.  I use fvwm2(nvidia X driver) as
a window manager which does not work with the 9i install program, works
fine with the default Gnomish(nv X driver), it could have been the X
driver too.

With Redhat9 it is REAL important to set LD_ASSUME_KERNEL to 2.4.1.

I didn't try this but it may be possible to install what is needed by
only downloading the first disk saving some 1.3GB of download fun.

I installed a custom install from the client group.  The packages I
installed are the Programmers section and sqlplus.  I noticed that the
Pro*C when on as a result of the checking the Programmers section I
assume.

Once Oracle was installed properly the DBD::Oracle install went as
smooth as just about every other CPAN module.

=head1 Oracle 10g Instantclient

The Makefile.PL will now work for  Oracle 10g Instantclient. To have both the Compile and
the test.pl to work you must first have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly set to your
"instantclient" directory. (http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/instantclient.html)

The present version of the make creates a link on your "instantclient" directory as follows
"ln -s libclntsh.so.10.1 libclntsh.so". It is needed for both the makefile creation and the compile
but is not need for the test.pl. It should be removed after the compile.

If the Makefile.PL or make fails try creating this link directly in your "instantclient" directory.

=head1 Oracle Database 10g Express Edition  10.2

To get 10Xe to compile correctly I had to add $ORACLE_HOME/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
as you would for an install against 10g Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, or
Enterprise Edition

=head1 UTF8 bug in Oracle  9.2.0.5.0 and 9.2.0.7.0

DBD::Oracle seems to hit some sort of bug with the above two versions of DB.
The bug seems to hit when you when the Oracle database charset: US7ASCII and the Oracle nchar charset: AL16UTF16 and it has also
been reported when the Oracle database charset: WE8ISO8850P1 Oracle nchar charset: AL32UTF16.

So far there is no patch for this but here are some workarounds

    use DBD::Oracle qw( SQLCS_IMPLICIT SQLCS_NCHAR );
    ...
    $sth->bind_param(1, $value, { ora_csform => SQLCS_NCHAR });

    or this way

    $dbh->{ora_ph_csform} = SQLCS_NCHAR; # default for all future placeholders

    or this way

    utf8::downgrade($parameter, 1);

=head1 NAME

DBD::Oracle::Troubleshooting::Macos - Tips and Hints to Troubleshoot DBD::Oracle on MacOs

=head1 VERSION

version 1.90

=head1 General Info

These instructions allow for the compilation and successful testing of
DBD::Oracle on MacOS X 10.2.4 and higher, using Oracle 9iR2 DR
(Release 9.2.0.1.0) or the 10g Instant Client release (10.1.0.3 at the
time of writing).

MacOS X DBD::Oracle has been tested (and used) under Jaguar (10.2.x),
Panther (10.3.x), Snow Leopard (10.6.x), Lion (10.7.x). Jaguar comes
with a Perl version of 5.6.0., which I can report to work with
DBD::Oracle 1.14 and higher once you take certain steps (see below).
You may want to install a later perl, e.g., Perl 5.8.x. Please refer to:

    Installing Perl 5.8 on Jaguar
    http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/perl.html

for Perl 5.8.0 installation instructions.

DBD::Oracle is likely to not install out of the box on MacOS X
10.2. nor on 10.3. Manual but different changes will most likely be
required on both versions.

The key problem on 10.2. (Jaguar) is a symbol clash (caused by a
function poll() named identically) between the IO library in at least
Perl 5.6.0 (which is the version that comes with 10.2) and the Oracle
client library in 9iR2 developer's release for MacOS X. The symptom is
that your build appears to compile fine but then fails in the link
stage. If you are running a (possibly self-installed) version of Perl
other than 5.6.0, there's a chance that you are not affected by the
symbol clash. So, try to build first without any special measures, and
only resort to the instructions below if your build fails in the link
stage with a duplicate symbol error. Note: if it fails to even
compile, solve that problem first since it is not due to the symbol
clash.
