	    Matsumoto)
Solution:   Set "curbuf" to a valid value in win_close().
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 5.6.031
Problem:    Multi-byte: When a double-byte character ends in CSI, Vim waits
	    for another character to be typed.
Solution:   Recognize the CSI as the second byte of a character and don't wait
	    for another one. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 5.6.032
Problem:    Functions with an argument that is a line number don't all accept
	    ".", "$", etc. (Ralf Arens)
Solution:   Add get_art_lnum() and use it for setline(), line2byte() and
	    synID().
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 5.6.033
Problem:    Multi-byte: "f " sometimes skips to the second space.  (Sung-Hyun
	    Nam)
Solution:   Change logic in searchc() to skip trailing byte of a double-byte
	    character.
	    Also: Ask for second byte when searching for double-byte
	    character. (Park Chong-Dae)
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 5.6.034 (extra)
Problem:    Compiling with Borland C++ 5.5 fails on tolower() and toupper().
Solution:   Use TO_LOWER() and TO_UPPER() instead.  Also adjust the Makefile
	    to make using bcc 5.5 easier.
Files:	    src/edit.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/misc1.c, src/Makefile.bor

Patch 5.6.035
Problem:    Listing the"+comments" feature in the ":version" output depended
	    on the wrong ID. (Stephen P. Wall)
Solution:   Change "CRYPTV" to "COMMENTS".
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 5.6.036

Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/multbyte.c

Patch 5.6.038
Problem:    Multi-clicks in GUI are interpreted as a mouse wheel click.  When
	    'ttymouse' is "xterm" a mouse click is interpreted as a mouse
	    wheel click.
Solution:   Don't recognize the mouse wheel in check_termcode() in the GUI.
	    Use 0x43 for a mouse drag in do_xterm_trace(), not 0x63.
Files:	    src/term.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.6.039
Problem:    Motif GUI under KDE: When trying to logout, Vim hangs up the
	    system. (Hermann Rochholz)
Solution:   When handling the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF event, set the WM_COMMAND
	    property of the window to let the session manager know we finished
	    saving ourselves.
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c

Patch 5.6.040
Problem:    When using ":s" command, matching the regexp is done twice.
Solution:   After copying the matched line, adjust the pointers instead of
	    finding the match again. (Loic Grenie)  Added vim_regnewptr().
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/regexp.c, src/proto/regexp.pro

Patch 5.6.041
Problem:    GUI: Athena, Motif and GTK don't give more than 10 dialog buttons.
Solution:   Remove the limit on the number of buttons.
	    Also support the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.
	    For GTK: Center the buttons.
Files:	    src/gui_athena.c, src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui_motif.c

Patch 5.6.042

Patch 5.6.043 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: When selecting guifont with the dialog, 'guifont'
	    doesn't include the bold or italic attributes.
Solution:   Append ":i" and/or ":b" to 'guifont' in gui_mch_init_font().
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.6.044 (extra)
Problem:    MS-DOS and Windows: The line that dosinst.exe appends to
	    autoexec.bat to set PATH is wrong when Vim is in a directory with
	    an embedded space.
Solution:   Use double quotes for the value when there is an embedded space.
Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 5.6.045 (extra) (fixed version)
Problem:    VMS: Various small problems.
Solution:   Many small changes. (Zoltan Arpadffy)
	    File name modifier ":h" keeps the path separator.
	    File name modifier ":e" also removes version.
	    Compile with MAX_FEAT by default.
	    When checking for autocommands ignore version in file name.
	    Be aware of file names being case insensitive.
	    Added vt320 builtin termcap.
	    Be prepared for an empty default_vim_dir.

Solution:   Fix slashes in file name arguments after reading the vimrc file.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 5.6.047
Problem:    $CPPFLAGS is not passed on to ctags configure.
Solution:   Add it. (Walter Briscoe)
Files:	    src/config.mk.in, src/Makefile

Patch 5.6.048
Problem:    CTRL-R in Command-line mode is documented to insert text as typed,
	    but inserts text literally.
Solution:   Make CTRL-R insert text as typed, use CTRL-R CTRL-R to insert
	    literally.  This is consistent with Insert mode.  But characters
	    that end Command-line mode are inserted literally.
Files:	    runtime/doc/index.txt, runtime/doc/cmdline.txt, src/ex_getln.c,
	    src/ops.c, src/proto/ops.pro

Patch 5.6.049
Problem:    Documentation for [!] after ":ijump" is wrong way around. (Benji
	    Fisher)
Solution:   Fix the documentation.  Also improve the code to check for a match
	    after a /* */ comment.
Files:	    runtime/doc/tagsearch.txt, src/search.c

Patch 5.6.050
Problem:    Replacing is wrong when replacing a single-byte char with
	    double-byte char or the other way around.
Solution:   Shift the text after the character when it is replaced.
	    (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/normal.c, src/misc1.c

Patch 5.6.051
Problem:    ":tprev" and ":tnext" don't give an error message when trying to
	    go before the first or beyond the last tag. (Robert Webb)
Solution:   Added error messages.  Also: Delay a second when a file-read
	    message is going to overwrite an error message, otherwise it won't
	    be seen.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/tag.c

Patch 5.6.052
Problem:    Multi-byte: When an Ex command has a '|' or '"' as a second byte,
	    it terminates the command.
Solution:   Skip second byte of multibyte char when checking for '|' and '"'.
	    (Asai Kenichi)
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.6.053
Problem:    CTRL-] doesn't work on a tag that contains a '|'. (Cesar Crusius)
Solution:   Escape '|', '"' and '\' in tag names when using CTRL-] and also
	    for command-line completion.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/normal.c

Patch 5.6.054
Problem:    When using ":e" and ":e #" the cursor is put in the first column
	    when 'startofline' is set. (Cordell)
Solution:   Use the last known column when 'startofline' is set.
	    Also, use ECMD_LAST more often to simplify the code.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/proto/buffer.pro

Patch 5.6.055
Problem:    When 'statusline' only contains a text without "%" and doesn't fit
	    in the window, Vim crashes. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Don't use the pointer for the first item if there is no item.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 5.6.056 (extra)
Problem:    MS-DOS: F11 and F12 don't work when 'bioskey' is set.
Solution:   Use enhanced keyboard functions. (Vince Negri)
	    Detect presence of enhanced keyboard and set bioskey_read and
	    bioskey_ready.
Files:	    src/os_msdos.c

Patch 5.6.057 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: Multi-byte characters are wrong in dialogs and tear-off
	    menus.
Solution:   Use system font instead of a fixed font. (Matsumoto, Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.6.058
Problem:    When the 'a' flag is not in 'guioptions', non-Windows systems
	    copy Visually selected text to the clipboard/selection on a yank
	    or delete command anyway.  On Windows it isn't done even when the
	    'a' flag is included.
Solution:   Respect the 'a' flag in 'guioptions' on all systems.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 5.6.059 (extra)
Problem:    When moving the cursor over italic text and the characters spill
	    over to the cell on the right, that spill-over is deleted.
	    Noticed in the Win32 GUI, can happen on other systems too.
Solution:   Redraw italic text starting from a blank, like this is already
	    done for bold text. (Vince Negri)
Files:	    src/gui.c, src/gui.h, src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.6.060
Problem:    Some bold characters spill over to the cell on the left, that
	    spill-over can remain sometimes.
Solution:   Redraw a character when the next character was bold and needs
	    redrawing. (Robert Webb)
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 5.6.061
Problem:    When xterm sends 8-bit controls, recognizing the version response
	    doesn't work.
	    When using CSI instead of <Esc>[ for the termcap color codes,
	    using 16 colors doesn't work. (Neil Bird)
Solution:   Also accept CSI in place of <Esc>[ for the version string.
	    Also check for CSI when handling colors 8-15 in term_color().
	    Use CSI for builtin xterm termcap entries when 'term' contains
	    "8bit".
Files:	    runtime/doc/term.txt, src/ex_cmds.c, src/option.c, src/term.c,
	    src/os_unix.c, src/proto/option.pro, src/proto/term.pro

Patch 5.6.062
Problem:    The documentation says that setting 'smartindent' doesn't have an
	    effect when 'cindent' is set, but it does make a difference for
	    lines starting with "#". (Neil Bird)
Solution:   Really ignore 'smartindent' when 'cindent' is set.
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/ops.c

Patch 5.6.063
Problem:    Using "I" in Visual-block mode doesn't accept a count. (Johannes
	    Zellner)
Solution:   Pass the count on to do_insert() and edit(). (Allan Kelly)
Files:	    src/normal.c, src/ops.c, src/proto/ops.pro

Patch 5.6.064
Problem:    MS-DOS and Win32 console: Mouse doesn't work correctly after
	    including patch 5.6.28. (Vince Negri)
Solution:   Don't check for mouse scroll wheel when the mouse code contains
	    the number of clicks.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 5.6.065
Problem:    After moving the cursor around in Insert mode, typing a space can
	    still trigger an abbreviation. (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Don't check for an abbreviation after moving around in Insert mode.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 5.6.066
Problem:    Still a few bold character spill-over remains after patch 60.
Solution:   Clear character just in front of blanking out rest of the line.
	    (Robert Webb)
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 5.6.067
Problem:    When a file name contains a NL, the viminfo file is corrupted.
Solution:   Use viminfo_writestring() to convert the NL to CTRL-V n.
	    Also fix the Buffers menu and listing a menu name with a newline.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/buffer.c, src/mark.c, src/menu.c

Patch 5.6.068
Problem:    Compiling the Perl interface doesn't work with Perl 5.6.0.
	    (Bernhard Rosenkraenzer)
Solution:   Also check xs_apiversion for the version number when prepending
	    defines for PL_*.
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 5.6.069
Problem:    "go" doesn't always end up at the right character when
	    'fileformat' is "dos". (Bruce DeVisser)
Solution:   Correct computations in ml_find_line_or_offset().
Files:	    src/memline.

Patch 5.6.070 (depends on 5.6.068)
Problem:    Compiling the Perl interface doesn't work with Perl 5.6.0.
	    (Bernhard Rosenkraenzer)
Solution:   Simpler check instead of the one from patch 68.
Files:	    src/Makefile

	    the right. (Michael Haumann)
Solution:   Correct the column computation in op_insert().
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.6.072
Problem:    When starting Vim with "vim +startinsert", it enters Insert mode
	    only after typing the first command. (Andrew Pimlott)
Solution:   Insert a dummy command in the stuff buffer.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 5.6.073 (extra) (depends on 5.6.034)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: When compiled with Bcc 5.5 menus don't work.
	    In dosinst.c toupper() and tolower() give an "internal compiler
	    error" for Bcc 5.5.
Solution:   Define WINVER to 4 to avoid compiling for Windows 2000. (Dan
	    Sharp)  Also cleaned up compilation arguments.
	    Use our own implementation of toupper() in dosinst.c.  Use
	    mytoupper() instead of tolower().
Files:	    src/Makefile.bor, src/dosinst.c

Patch 5.6.074 (extra)
Problem:    Entering CSI directly doesn't always work, because it's recognized
	    as the start of a special key.  Mostly a problem with multibyte
	    in the GUI.
Solution:   Use K_CSI for a typed CSI character.  Use <CSI> for a normal CSI,
	    <xCSI> for a CSI typed in the GUI.

Patch 5.6.075
Problem:    When using "I" or "A" in Visual block mode while 'sts' is set may
	    change spaces to a Tab the inserted text is not correct. (Mike
	    Steed)  And some other problems when using "A" to append after the
	    end of the line.
Solution:   Check for change in spaces/tabs after inserting the text.  Append
	    spaces to fill the gap between the end-of-line and the right edge
	    of the block.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.6.076
Problem:    GTK GUI: Mapping <M-Space> doesn't work.

Patch 5.6.080
Problem:    When jumping to a tag, generating the tags file and jumping to the
	    same tag again uses the old search pattern. (Sung-Hyun Nam)
Solution:   Flush cached tag matches when executing an external command.
Files:	    src/misc2.c, src/proto/tag.pro, src/tag.c

Patch 5.6.081
Problem:    ":syn include" uses a level for the included file, this confuses
	    contained items included at the same level.
Solution:   Use a unique tag for each included file.  Changed sp_syn_inc_lvl
	    to sp_syn_inc_tag. (Scott Bigham)
Files:	    src/syntax.c, src/structs.h

Patch 5.6.082

Patch 5.6.084 (depends on 5.6.074)
Problem:    GUI: Entering CSI doesn't always work for Athena and Motif.
Solution:   Handle typed CSI as <xCSI> (forgot this bit in 5.6.074).
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c

Patch 5.6.085
Problem:    Multi-byte: Using "r" to replace a double-byte char with a
	    single-byte char moved the cursor one character. (Matsumoto)
	    Also, using a count when replacing a single-byte char with a
	    double-byte char didn't work.
Solution:   Don't use del_char() to delete the second byte.
	    Get "ptr" again after calling ins_char().
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 5.6.086 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When using libcall() and the returned value is not a valid
	    pointer, Vim crashes.
Solution:   Use IsBadStringPtr() to check if the pointer is valid.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 5.6.087
Problem:    Multi-byte: Commands and messages with multibyte characters are
	    displayed wrong.

	    is not being used.
Solution:   Remove that message.
Files:	    src/multbyte.c

Patch 5.6.089
Problem:    On non-Unix systems it's possible to overwrite a read-only file

Patch 5.6.091
Problem:    When editing many "no file" files, can't create swap file, because

Solution:   Also use ".sv[a-z]", ".su[a-z]", etc.
Files:	    src/memline.c

Patch 5.6.092
Problem:    FreeBSD: When setting $TERM to a non-valid terminal name, Vim
	    hangs in tputs().
Solution:   After tgetent() returns an error code, call it again with the
	    terminal name "dumb".  This apparently creates an environment in
	    which tputs() doesn't fail.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 5.6.093 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: "ls | gvim -" will show a message box about reading

Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 5.7a.005
Problem:    When ":s//~/" doesn't find a match it reports "[NULL]" for the
	    pattern.
Solution:   Use get_search_pat() to obtain the actually used pattern.

Patch 5.7a.007
Problem:    Motif and Athena GUI: CTRL-@ is interpreted as CTRL-C.
Solution:   Only use "intr_char" when it has been set.
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c

Patch 5.7a.008
Problem:    GTK GUI: When using CTRL-L the screen is redrawn twice, causing
	    trouble for bold characters.  Also happens when moving with the
	    scrollbar.  Best seen when 'writedelay' is non-zero.
	    When starting the GUI with ":gui" the screen is redrawn once with
	    the wrong colors.
Solution:   Only set the geometry hints when the window size really changed.
	    This avoids setting it each time the scrollbar is forcefully
	    redrawn.
	    Don't redraw in expose_event() when gui.starting is still set.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 5.7.015
Problem:    Syntax files for Vim 6.0 can't be used with 5.x.
Solution:   Add the "default" argument to the ":highlight" command: Ignore the
	    command if highlighting was already specified.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Generate the Syntax menu with makemenu.vim, so that it doesn't have to be done
when Vim is starting up.  Reduces the startup time of the GUI.


Fixed							*fixed-5.8*
-----

Conversion of docs to HTML didn't convert "|tag|s" to a hyperlink.

Fixed compiling under NeXT. (Jeroen C.M. Goudswaard)

optwin.vim gave an error when used in Vi compatible mode ('cpo' contains 'C').

Tcl interpreter: "buffer" command didn't check for presence of an argument.
(Dave Bodenstab)

dosinst.c: Added checks for too long file name.

Amiga: a file name starting with a colon was considered absolute but it isn't.
Amiga: ":pwd" added a slash when in the root of a drive.

Macintosh: Warnings for unused variables. (Bernhard Pruemmer)

Unix: When catching a deadly signal, handle it in such a way that it's
unlikely that Vim will hang.  Call _exit() instead of exit() in case of a
severe problem.

Setting the window title from nothing to something didn't work after patch 29.

Check for ownership of .exrc and .vimrc was done with stat().  Use lstat() as
well for extra security.

Win32 GUI: Printing a file with 'fileformat' "unix" didn't work.  Set
'fileformat' to "dos" before writing the temp file.

Unix: Could start waiting for a character when checking for a CTRL-C typed
when an X event is received.

Could not use Perl and Python at the same time on FreeBSD, because Perl used
"-lc" and Python used the threaded C library.

Win32: The Mingw compiler gave a few warning messages.

When using "ZZ" and an autocommand for writing uses an abbreviation it didn't
work.  Don't stuff the ":x" command but execute it directly. (Mikael Berthe)

VMS doesn't always have lstat(), added an #ifdef around it.

Added a few corrections for the Macintosh. (Axel Kielhorn)

Win32: GvimExt could not edit more than a few files at once, the length of the
argument was fixed.


Previously released patches for Vim 5.7:

Patch 5.7.001
Problem:    When the current buffer is encrypted, and another modified buffer
	    isn't, ":wall" will encrypt the other buffer.
Solution:   In buf_write() use "buf" instead of "curbuf" to check for the
	    crypt key.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 5.7.002
Problem:    When 'showmode' is set, using "CTRL-O :r file" waits three seconds
	    before displaying the read text. (Wichert Akkerman)
Solution:   Set "keep_msg" to the file message so that the screen is redrawn
	    before the three seconds wait for displaying the mode message.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 5.7.003
Problem:    Searching for "[[:cntrl:]]" doesn't work.
Solution:   Exclude NUL from the matching characters, it terminates the list.
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 5.7.004
Problem:    GTK: When selecting a new font, Vim can crash.
Solution:   In gui_mch_init_font() unreference the old font, not the new one.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 5.7.005
Problem:    Multibyte: Inserting a wrapped line corrupts kterm screen.
	    Pasting TEXT/COMPOUND_TEXT into Vim does not work.
	    On Motif no XIM status line is displayed even though it is
	    available.
Solution:   Don't use xterm trick for wrapping lines for multibyte mode.
	    Correct a missing "break", added TEXT/COMPOUND_TEXT selection
	    request.
	    Add XIMStatusArea fallback code.
	    (Katsuhito Nagano)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/multbyte.c, src/screen.c, src/ui.c

Patch 5.7.006
Problem:    GUI: redrawing the non-Visual selection is wrong when the window
	    is unobscured. (Jean-Pierre Etienne)
Solution:   Redraw the selection properly and don't clear it.  Added "len"
	    argument to clip_may_redraw_selection().
Files:	    src/gui.c, src/ui.c, src/proto/ui.pro

Patch 5.7.007
Problem:    Python: Crash when using the current buffer twice.
Solution:   Increase the reference count for buffer and window objects.
	    (Johannes Zellner)
Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 5.7.008
Problem:    In Ex mode, backspacing over the first TAB doesn't work properly.
	    (Wichert Akkerman)
Solution:   Switch the cursor on before printing the newline.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 5.7.009 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: Crash when using a long file.
Solution:   Don't redefine malloc() and free(), because it will break using
	    realloc().
Files:	    src/os_mac.h

Patch 5.7.010
Problem:    When using CTRL-A on a very long number Vim can crash.  (Michael
	    Naumann)
Solution:   Truncate the length of the new number to avoid a buffer overflow.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.7.011 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI on NT 5 and Win98: Displaying Hebrew is reversed.
Solution:   Output each character separately, to avoid that Windows reverses
	    the text for some fonts. (Ron Aaron)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.7.012
Problem:    When using "-complete=buffer" for ":command" the user command
	    fails.
Solution:   In a user command don't replace the buffer name with a count for
	    the  buffer number.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.7.013
Problem:    "gD" didn't always find a match in the first line, depending on
	    the column the search started at.
Solution:   Reset the column to zero before starting to search.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 5.7.014
Problem:    Rot13 encoding was done on characters with accents, which is
	    wrong. (Sven Gottwald)
Solution:   Only do rot13 encoding on ASCII characters.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.7.016
Problem:    When hitting 'n' for a ":s///c" command, the ignore-case flag was
	    not restored, some matches were skipped. (Daniel Blaustein)
Solution:   Restore the reg_ic variable when 'n' was hit.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 5.7.017
Problem:    When using a Vim script for Vim 6.0 with <SID> before a function
	    name, it produces an error message even when inside an "if version
	    >= 600".  (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Ignore errors in the function name when the function is not going
	    to be defined.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 5.7.018
Problem:    When running "rvim" or "vim -Z" it was still possible to execute a
	    shell command with system() and backtick-expansion. (Antonios A.
	    Kavarnos)
Solution:   Disallow executing a shell command in get_cmd_output() and
	    mch_expand_wildcards().
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.7.019
Problem:    Multibyte: In a substitute string, a multibyte character isn't
	    skipped properly, can be a problem when the second byte is a
	    backslash.
Solution:   Skip an extra byte for a double-byte character. (Muraoka Taro)
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 5.7.020
Problem:    Compilation doesn't work on MacOS-X.
Solution:   Add a couple of #ifdefs. (Jamie Curmi)
Files:	    src/regexp.c, src/ctags/general.h

Patch 5.7.021
Problem:    Vim sometimes produces a beep when started in an xterm.  Only
	    happens when compiled without mouse support.
Solution:   Requesting the xterm version results in a K_IGNORE.  This wasn't
	    handled when mouse support is disabled.  Accept K_IGNORE always.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 5.7.022
Problem:    %v in 'statusline' is not displayed when it's equal to %c.
Solution:   Check if %V or %v is used and handle them differently.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 5.7.023
Problem:    Crash when a WinLeave autocommand deletes the buffer in the other
	    window.
Solution:   Check that after executing the WinLeave autocommands there still
	    is a window to be closed.  Also update the test that was supposed
	    to check for this problem.
Files:	    src/window.c, testdir/test13.in, testdir/test13.ok

Patch 5.7.024
Problem:    Evaluating an expression for 'statusline' can have side effects.
Solution:   Evaluate the expression in a sandbox.
Files:	    src/edit.c, src/eval.c, src/proto/eval.pro, src/ex_cmds.c,
	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/ex_docmd.c, src/globals.h, src/option.c,
	    src/screen.c, src/undo.c

Patch 5.7.025 (fixed)
Problem:    Creating a temp file has a race condition.
Solution:   Create a private directory to write the temp files in.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/misc1.c, src/proto/misc1.pro,
	    src/proto/fileio.pro, src/memline.c, src/os_unix.h

Patch 5.7.026 (extra)
Problem:    Creating a temp file has a race condition.
Solution:   Create a private directory to write the temp files in.
	    This is the extra part of patch 5.7.025.
Files:	    src/os_msdos.h

Patch 5.7.027
Problem:    Starting to edit a file can cause a crash.  For example when in
	    Insert mode, using CTRL-O :help abbr<Tab> to scroll the screen and
	    then <CR>, which edits a help file. (Robert Bogomip)
Solution:   Check if keep_msg is NULL before copying it.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 5.7.028
Problem:    Creating a backup or swap file could fail in rare situations.
Solution:   Use O_EXCL for open().
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/memfile.c

Patch 5.7.029
Problem:    Editing a file with an extremely long name crashed Vim.
Solution:   Check for length of the name when setting the window title.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 5.7.030
Problem:    A ":make" or ":grep" command with a very long argument could cause
	    a crash.
Solution:   Allocate the buffer for the shell command.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-6*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 5.x to 6.0


Cursor position in Visual mode			*curpos-visual*
------------------------------

When going from one window to another window on the same buffer while in
Visual mode, the cursor position of the other window is adjusted to keep the
same Visual area.  This can be used to set the start of the Visual area in one
window and the end in another.  In vim 5.x the cursor position of the other
window would be used, which could be anywhere and was not very useful.


Substitute command Vi compatible		*substitute-CR*
--------------------------------

The substitute string (the "to" part of the substitute command) has been made
Vi compatible.  Previously a CTRL-V had a special meaning and could be used to
prevent a <CR> to insert a line break.  This made it impossible to insert a
CTRL-V before a line break.  Now a backslash is used to prevent a <CR> to
cause a line break.  Since the number of backslashes is halved, it is still
possible to insert a line break at the end of the line.  This now works just
like Vi, but it's not compatible with Vim versions before 6.0.

When a ":s" command doesn't make any substitutions, it no longer sets the '[
and '] marks.  This is not related to Vi, since it doesn't have these marks.
