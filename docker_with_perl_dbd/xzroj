<p>In building application software packages, a programmer often has to
deal with a number of libraries, each of which can use a different
error-reporting mechanism.  Sometimes one of two values is returned,
indicating simply SUCCESS or FAILURE, with no description of errors
encountered.  Sometimes it is an index into a table of text strings,
where the name of the table used is dependent on the library being
used when the error is generated; since each table starts numbering at
0 or 1, additional information as to the source of the error code is
needed to determine which table to look at.  Sometimes no text messages are
supplied at all, and the programmer must supply them at any point at which
he may wish to report error conditions.
Often, a global variable is assigned some value describing the error, but
the programmer has to know in each case whether to look at <code>errno</code>,
<code>h_errno</code>, the return value from <code>hes_err()</code>, or whatever other
variables or routines are specified.
And what happens if something
in the procedure of
examining or reporting the error changes the same variable?
</p>
<p>The package we have developed is an attempt to present a common
error-handling mechanism to manipulate the most common form of error code
in a fashion that does not have the problems listed above.
</p>
<p>A list of up to 256 text messages is supplied to a translator we have
written, along with the three- to four-character &ldquo;name&rdquo; of the error
table.  The library using this error table need only call a routine
generated from this error-table source to make the table &ldquo;known&rdquo; to the
com_err library, and any error code the library generates can be converted
to the corresponding error message.  There is also a default format for
error codes accidentally returned before making the table known, which is
of the form &lsquo;<samp>unknown code foo 32</samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo; would be the name
of the table.

<span id="Error-codes-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">2 Error codes</h2>

<p>Error codes themselves are 32 bit (signed) integers, of which the high
order 24 bits are an identifier of which error table the error code is
from, and the low order 8 bits are a sequential error number within
the table.  An error code may thus be easily decomposed into its component
parts.  Only the lowest 32 bits of an error code are considered significant
on systems which support wider values.
</p>
<p>Error table 0 is defined to match the UNIX system call error table
(<code>sys_errlist</code>); this allows <code>errno</code> values to be used directly
in the library (assuming that <code>errno</code> is of a type with the same width
as <tt>long</tt>).  Other error table numbers are formed by compacting together
the first four characters of the error table name.  The mapping between
characters in the name and numeric values in the error code are defined in
a system-independent fashion, so that two systems that can pass integral
values between them can reliably pass error codes without loss of meaning;
this should work even if the character sets used are not the same.
(However, if this is to be done, error table 0 should be avoided, since the
local system call error tables may differ.)
</p>
<p>Any variable which is to contain an error code should be declared <tt>long</tt>.
The draft proposed American National Standard for C (as of May, 1988)
requires that <tt>long</tt> variables be at least 32 bits; any system which does
not support 32-bit <tt>long</tt> values cannot make use of this package (nor
much other software that assumes an ANSI-C environment base) without
significant effort.
