# ABSTRACT: Convert CPAN distribution metadata structures

=head1 NAME

CPAN::Meta::Converter - Convert CPAN distribution metadata structures

=head1 VERSION

version 2.150010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $struct = decode_json_file('META.json');

  my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct );

  my $new_struct = $cmc->convert( version => "2" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module converts CPAN Meta structures from one form to another.  The
primary use is to convert older structures to the most modern version of
the specification, but other transformations may be implemented in the
future as needed.  (E.g. stripping all custom fields or stripping all
optional fields.)

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct );

The constructor should be passed a valid metadata structure but invalid
structures are accepted.  If no meta-spec version is provided, version 1.0 will
be assumed.

Optionally, you can provide a C<default_version> argument after C<$struct>:

  my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct, default_version => "1.4" );

This is only needed when converting a metadata fragment that does not include a
C<meta-spec> field.

=head2 convert

  my $new_struct = $cmc->convert( version => "2" );

Returns a new hash reference with the metadata converted to a different form.
C<convert> will die if any conversion/standardization still results in an
invalid structure.

Valid parameters include:

=over

=item *

C<version> -- Indicates the desired specification version (e.g. "1.0", "1.1" ... "1.4", "2").
Defaults to the latest version of the CPAN Meta Spec.

=back

Conversion proceeds through each version in turn.  For example, a version 1.2
structure might be converted to 1.3 then 1.4 then finally to version 2. The
conversion process attempts to clean-up simple errors and standardize data.
For example, if C<author> is given as a scalar, it will converted to an array
reference containing the item. (Converting a structure to its own version will
also clean-up and standardize.)

When data are cleaned and standardized, missing or invalid fields will be
replaced with sensible defaults when possible.  This may be lossy or imprecise.
For example, some badly structured META.yml files on CPAN have prerequisite
modules listed as both keys and values:

  requires => { 'Foo::Bar' => 'Bam::Baz' }

These would be split and each converted to a prerequisite with a minimum
version of zero.

When some mandatory fields are missing or invalid, the conversion will attempt
to provide a sensible default or will fill them with a value of 'unknown'.  For
example a missing or unrecognized C<license> field will result in a C<license>
field of 'unknown'.  Fields that may get an 'unknown' include:

=over 4

=item *

abstract

=item *

author

=item *

license

=back

=head2 upgrade_fragment

  my $new_struct = $cmc->upgrade_fragment;

Returns a new hash reference with the metadata converted to the latest version
of the CPAN Meta Spec.  No validation is done on the result -- you must
validate after merging fragments into a complete metadata document.

Available since version 2.141170.

=head1 NAME

CPAN::Meta::Feature - an optional feature provided by a CPAN distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 2.150010

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CPAN::Meta::Feature object describes an optional feature offered by a CPAN
distribution and specified in the distribution's F<META.json> (or F<META.yml>)
file.

For the most part, this class will only be used when operating on the result of
the C<feature> or C<features> methods on a L<CPAN::Meta> object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $feature = CPAN::Meta::Feature->new( $identifier => \%spec );

This returns a new Feature object.  The C<%spec> argument to the constructor
should be the same as the value of the C<optional_feature> entry in the
distmeta.  It must contain entries for C<description> and C<prereqs>.

=head2 identifier

This method returns the feature's identifier.

=head2 description

This method returns the feature's long description.

=head2 prereqs

This method returns the feature's prerequisites as a L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs>
object.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker.
Bugs can be submitted through the web interface at

CPAN::Meta::History::Meta_1_0 - Version 1.0 metadata specification for META.yml

=head1 PREFACE

This is a historical copy of the version 1.0 specification for F<META.yml>
files, copyright by Ken Williams and licensed under the same terms as Perl
itself.

Modifications from the original:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes version 1.0 of the F<META.yml> specification.

The META.yml file describes important properties of contributed Perl
distributions such as the ones found on L<CPAN|http://www.cpan.org>.  It is
typically created by tools like L<Module::Build> and L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>.

The fields in the F<META.yml> file are meant to be helpful to people
maintaining module collections (like CPAN), for people writing
installation tools (like L<CPAN> or L<CPANPLUS>), or just people who want to
know some stuff about a distribution before downloading it and starting to
install it.

=head1 Format

F<META.yml> files are written in the L<YAML|http://www.yaml.org/> format.  The
reasons we chose YAML instead of, say, XML or Data::Dumper are discussed in
L<this thread|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.makemaker/2002/04/msg406.html>
on the MakeMaker mailing list.

The first line of a F<META.yml> file should be a valid
L<YAML document header|http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html#syntax-document>
like C<"--- #YAML:1.0">

=head1 Fields

The rest of the META.yml file is one big YAML
L<mapping|http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html#syntax-mapping>,
whose keys are described here.

=over 4

=item name

Example: C<Module-Build>

The name of the distribution.  Often created by taking the "main
module" in the distribution and changing "::" to "-".  Sometimes it's
completely different, however, as in the case of the
L<libwww-perl|http://search.cpan.org/author/GAAS/libwww-perl/> distribution.

=item version

Example: C<0.16>

The version of the distribution to which the META.yml file refers.

=item license

Example: C<perl>

The license under which this distribution may be used and
redistributed.

Must be one of the following licenses:

=over 4

=item perl

The distribution may be copied and redistributed under the same terms as perl
itself (this is by far the most common licensing option for modules on CPAN).
This is a dual license, in which the user may choose between either the GPL
version 1 or the Artistic version 1 license.

=item gpl

The distribution is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License version 2 (L<http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0>).

=item lgpl

The distribution is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License version 2 (L<http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1>).

=item artistic

The distribution is licensed under the Artistic License version 1, as specified
by the Artistic file in the standard perl distribution
(L<http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-Perl-1.0>).

=item bsd

The distribution is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License
(L<http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>).

=item open_source

The distribution is licensed under some other Open Source Initiative-approved
license listed at L<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/>.

=item unrestricted

The distribution is licensed under a license that is B<not> approved by
L<www.opensource.org|http://www.opensource.org/> but that allows distribution
without restrictions.

=item restrictive

The distribution may not be redistributed without special permission from the
author and/or copyright holder.

=back

=item distribution_type

Example: C<module>

What kind of stuff is contained in this distribution.  Most things on
CPAN are C<module>s (which can also mean a collection of
modules), but some things are C<script>s.

=item requires

Example:

  Data::Dumper: 0
  File::Find: 1.03

A YAML L<mapping|http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html#syntax-mapping>
indicating the Perl modules this distribution requires for proper
operation.  The keys are the module names, and the values are version
specifications as described in the
L<documentation for Module::Build's "requires" parameter|Module::Build::API/requires>.

I<Note: the exact nature of the fancy specifications like
C<< ">= 1.2, != 1.5, < 2.0" >> is subject to
change.  Advance notice will be given here.  The simple specifications
like C<"1.2"> will not change in format.>

=item recommends

Example:

  Data::Dumper: 0
  File::Find: 1.03

A YAML L<mapping|http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html#syntax-mapping>
indicating the Perl modules this distribution recommends for enhanced
operation.

=item build_requires

Example:

  Data::Dumper: 0
  File::Find: 1.03

A YAML L<mapping|http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html#syntax-mapping>
indicating the Perl modules required for building and/or testing of
this distribution.  These dependencies are not required after the
module is installed.

=item conflicts

Example:

  Data::Dumper: 0
  File::Find: 1.03

A YAML L<mapping|http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html#syntax-mapping>
indicating the Perl modules that cannot be installed while this
distribution is installed.  This is a pretty uncommon situation.

=item dynamic_config

Example: C<0>

A boolean flag indicating whether a F<Build.PL> or
F<Makefile.PL> (or similar) must be executed, or whether this
module can be built, tested and installed solely from consulting its
metadata file.  The main reason to set this to a true value if that
your module performs some dynamic configuration (asking questions,
sensing the environment, etc.) as part of its build/install process.

Currently L<Module::Build> doesn't actually do anything with
this flag - it's probably going to be up to higher-level tools like
L<CPAN.pm|CPAN> to do something useful with it.  It can potentially
bring lots of security, packaging, and convenience improvements.

=item generated_by

Example: C<Module::Build version 0.16>

Indicates the tool that was used to create this F<META.yml> file.  It's
good form to include both the name of the tool and its version, but
this field is essentially opaque, at least for the moment.

=item version

Example: C<0.16>

The version of the distribution to which the META.yml file refers.
This is a mandatory field.

The version is essentially an arbitrary string, but I<must> be
only ASCII characters, and I<strongly should> be of the format
integer-dot-digit-digit, i.e. C<25.57>, optionally followed by
underscore-digit-digit, i.e. C<25.57_04>.

The standard tools that deal with module distribution (PAUSE, CPAN,
etc.) form an identifier for each distribution by joining the 'name'
and 'version' attributes with a dash (C<->) character.  Tools
who are prepared to deal with distributions that have no version
numbers generally omit the dash as well.

=item license

Example: C<perl>

a descriptive term for the licenses ... not authoritative, but must
be consistent with licensure statements in the READMEs, documentation, etc.

The license under which this distribution may be used and
redistributed.

Must be one of the following licenses:
