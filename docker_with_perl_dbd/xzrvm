</p><p>To output an XML document we have in memory we use the

the destination, the document and the stylesheet that has been applied
to it. The stylesheet is required so that output-related information
contained in the stylesheet, such as the encoding to be used, is used
in output. If no transformation has taken place, which will happen
when the user specifies no stylesheets at all in the command line, we
use the <tt class="function">xmlDocDump</tt> libxml function that saves the
source document to the file without further ado.</p><p>As parsed stylesheets take up space in memory, we take care to
free that memory after use with a call to
<tt class="function">xmlFreeStyleSheet</tt>. When all work is done, we
clean up all global variables used by the XSLT library using

allocated for the XML parser is reclaimed by a call to
<tt class="function">xmlCleanupParser</tt>. Before returning we deallocate

is easy, as the required libraries are almost certain to be already in
place (remember that libxml and libxslt are used by the GNOME project,
so they are present in most installations). The program can be
dynamically linked so that its footprint is minimized, or statically
linked, so that it stands by itself, carrying all required code.</p><p>For dynamic linking the following one liner will do:</p><p>
<b class="userinput"><tt>gcc -o libxslt_pipes -Wall -I/usr/include/libxml2 -lxslt
-lxml2 -L/usr/lib libxslt_pipes.c</tt></b>
</p><p>We assume that the necessary header files are in <tt class="filename">/usr/include/libxml2</tt> and that the
required libraries (<tt class="filename">libxslt.so</tt>,
<tt class="filename">libxml2.so</tt>) are in <tt class="filename">/usr/lib</tt>.</p><p>In general, a program may need to link to additional libraries,
depending on the processing it actually performs. A good way to start
is to use the <span><b class="command">xslt-config</b></span> script. The
<tt class="option">--help</tt> option displays usage
information. Running</p><p>
  <b class="userinput"><tt>
    xslt-config --cflags
  </tt></b>
</p><p>we get compile flags, while running</p><p>
  <b class="userinput"><tt>
    xslt-config --libs
  </tt></b>
</p><p>we get the library settings for the linker.</p><p>For static linking we must list more libraries than we did for
dynamic linking, as the libraries on which the libxsl and libxslt
libraries depend are also needed. Using <span><b class="command">xslt-config</b></span>
on a particular installation we create the following one-liner:</p><p>
<b class="userinput"><tt>
gcc -o libxslt_pipes -Wall -I/usr/include/libxml2 libxslt_pipes.c
-static -L/usr/lib -lxslt -lxml2 -lz -lpthread -lm
</tt></b>
</p><p>If we get warnings to the effect that some function in
statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared
libraries used from the glibc version used for linking, that means
that the binary is not completely static. Although we statically
linked against the GNU C runtime library glibc, glibc uses external
libraries to perform some of its functions. Same version libraries
must be present on the system we want the application to run. One way
to avoid this it to use an alternative C runtime, for example <a href="http://www.uclibc.org" target="_top">uClibc</a>, which requires obtaining
and building a uClibc toolchain first (if the reason for trying to get
a statically linked version of the program is to embed it somewhere,
using uClibc might be a good idea anyway).

Linking</h2></div></div></div><p>Compiling and linking in MS-Windows requires
some attention. First, the MS-Windows ports must be
downloaded and installed in the programming workstation. The ports are
available in <a href="http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html" target="_top">Igor
Zlatkovi&#263;'s site</a>. We need the ports for iconv, zlib, libxml,
and libxslt. In contrast to *NIX environments, we
cannot assume that the libraries needed will be present in other
computers where the program will be used. One solution is to
distribute the program along with the necessary dynamic
libraries. Another solution is to statically link the program so that
only a single executable file will have to be distributed.</p><p>We assume that we have decompressed the downloaded ports and
have placed the required contents of their <tt class="filename">include</tt> directories in an <tt class="filename">include</tt> directory in our file system. The
required contents include everything apart from the <tt class="filename">libexslt</tt> directory of the libxslt port,
as we are not using EXLST (an initiative to provide extensions to
XSLT) in this project. In order to compile the program we have to make
sure that all necessary header files are included. When using the
Microsoft compiler this translates to adding the required
<tt class="option">/I</tt> switches in the command line. If using a Visual
Studio product the same effect is attained by specifying additional
include directories in the compilation options. In the end, if the
headers have been copied in <tt class="filename">C:\include</tt> the command line must contain
<tt class="option">/I"C:\include" /I"C:\include\libslt"
/I"C:\include\libxml"</tt>.</p><p>This being a C program, it needs to be compiled against an
implementation of the C libraries. Microsoft provides various
implementations. The ports, however, have been compiled against the
<tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt> implementation, so it is wise to use
the same runtime in our project, lest we wish to come against
unexpected runtime crashes. The <tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt> is a
multi-threaded implementation and is specified by giving
<tt class="option">/MD</tt> as a compiler option. Unfortunately, the
correspondence between the <tt class="option">/MD</tt> switch and
<tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt> breaks after version 6 of the
Microsoft compiler. In version 7 and later (i.e., Visual Studio .NET),
<tt class="option">/MD</tt> links against a different DLL; in version 7.1
this is <tt class="filename">msvcrt71.dll</tt>. The end result of this bit
of esoterica is that if you try to dynamically link your application
with a compiler whose version is greater than 6, your program is
likely to crash unexpectedly. Alternatively, you may wish to compile
all iconv, zlib, libxml and libxslt yourself, using the new runtime
library. This is not a tall order, and some details are given
<a href="#windows-ports-build" title="Building the Ports in
MS-Windows">below</a>.</p><p>There are three kinds of libraries in MS-Windows. Dynamically
Linked Libraries (DLLs), like <tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt> we met
above, are used for dynamic linking; an application links to them at
runtime, so the application does not include the code contained in
them. Static libraries are used for static linking; an application
adds the libraries' code to its own code at link time. Import
libraries are used when building an application that uses DLLs. For
the application to be built, the linker must somehow find the
definitions of the functions that will be provided in runtime by the
DLLs, otherwise it will complain about unresolved references. Import
libraries contain function stubs that, for each DLL function we want
to call, know where to look for it in the DLL. In essence, in order to
use a DLL we must link against its corresponding import library. DLLs
have a <tt class="filename">.dll</tt> suffix; static and import libraries
both have a <tt class="filename">.lib</tt> suffix. In the MS-Windows ports
of libxml and libxslt static libraries are distinguished by their name
ending in <tt class="filename">_a.lib</tt>, while in the zlib port the
import library is <tt class="filename">zdll.lib</tt> and the static library
is <tt class="filename">zlib.lib</tt>. In what follows we assume we have a
<tt class="filename">lib</tt> directory in our filesystem
where we place the libraries we need for linking.</p><p>If we want to link dynamically we must make sure the <tt class="filename">lib</tt> directory contains
<tt class="filename">iconv.lib</tt>, <tt class="filename">libxslt.lib</tt>,
<tt class="filename">libxml2.lib</tt>, and
<tt class="filename">zdll.lib</tt>. When using the Microsoft linker this
translates to adding the required <tt class="option">/LIBPATH</tt>
switch and the necessary libraries in the command line. In Visual
Studio we must specify an additional library directory for <tt class="filename">lib</tt> and put the necessary libraries in
the additional dependencies. In the end, the command line must include
<tt class="option">/LIBPATH:"C:\lib" "lib\iconv.lib" "lib\libxslt.lib"
"lib\libxml2.lib" "lib\zdll.lib"</tt>, provided the libraries'
directory is <tt class="filename">C:\lib</tt>. In order
for the resulting executable to run, the ports DLLs must be present;
one way is to place all DLLs contained in the ports in the home
directory of our application, and make sure they are distributed
together.</p><p>If we want to link statically we must make sure the <tt class="filename">lib</tt> directory contains
<tt class="filename">iconv_a.lib</tt>, <tt class="filename">libxslt_a.lib</tt>,
<tt class="filename">libxml2_a.lib</tt>, and
<tt class="filename">zlib.lib</tt>. Adding <tt class="filename">lib</tt> as a library directory and putting
the necessary libraries in the additional dependencies, we get a
command line that should include <tt class="option">/LIBPATH:"C:\lib"
"lib\iconv_a.lib" "lib\libxslt_a.lib" "lib\libxml2_a.lib"
"lib\zlib.lib"</tt>. The resulting executable is much bigger
than if we linked dynamically; it is, however, self-contained and can
be distributed more easily, in theory at least. In practice, however,
the executable is not completely static. We saw that the ports are
compiled against <tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt>, so the program does
require that DLL at runtime. Moreover, since when using a version of
Microsoft developer tools with a version number greater than 6, we are
no longer using <tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt>, but another runtime
like <tt class="filename">msvcrt71.dll</tt>, and we then need that DLL.  In
contrast to <tt class="filename">msvcrt.dll</tt> it may not be present on
the target computer, so we may have to copy it along.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="windows-ports-build"></a>Building the Ports in
MS-Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>The source code of the ports is readily available on the web,
one has to check the ports sites. Each port can be built without
problems in an MS-Windows environment using Microsoft development
tools.  The necessary command line tools (compiler, linker,
<span><b class="command">nmake</b></span>) must be available. This means running a
batch file called <span><b class="command">vcvars32.bat</b></span> that comes with
Visual Studio (its exact location in the directory tree may vary
depending on the version of Visual Studio, but a file search will find
it anyway). Makefiles for the Microsoft tools are found in all
ports. They are distinguished by their suffix, e.g.,
<tt class="filename">Makefile.msvc</tt> or
<tt class="filename">Makefile.msc</tt>. To build zlib it suffices to run
<span><b class="command">nmake</b></span> against <tt class="filename">Makefile.msc</tt>
(i.e., with the <tt class="option">/F</tt> option); similarly, to build
<tt class="filename">iconv</tt> it suffices to run <span><b class="command">nmake</b></span>
against <tt class="filename">Makefile.msvc</tt>. Building libxml and
libxslt requires an extra configuration step; we must run the
<tt class="filename">configure.js</tt> configuration script with the
<span><b class="command">cscript</b></span> command. <tt class="filename">configure.js</tt>
is found in the <tt class="filename">win32</tt> directory
in the distributions. It is written in JScript, Microsoft's
implementation of the ECMA 262 language specification (ECMAScript
Edition 3), a JavaScript offspring. The configuration string takes a
number of parameters detailing our environment and needs;
<b class="userinput"><tt>cscript configure.js help</tt></b> documents
them.</p><p>It is wise to read all documentation files in the source
distributions before starting; moreover, pay attention to the
dependencies between the ports. If we configure libxml and libxslt to
use iconv and zlib we must build these two first and make sure their
headers and libraries can be found by the compiler and the
linker when building libxml and libxslt.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2839739"></a>zlib, iconv and All That</h2></div></div></div><p>We saw that libxml and libxslt depend on various other
libraries, for instance zlib, iconv, and so forth. Taking a look into
them gives us clues on the capabilities of libxml and libxslt.</p><p><a href="http://www.zlib.org" target="_top">zlib</a> is a free general
purpose lossless data compression library. It is a venerable
workhorse; more than <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/apps.html" target="_top">500 applications</a>
(both commercial and open source) seem to use the library. libxml uses
zlib so that it can read from or write to compressed files
directly. The <tt class="function">xmlParseFile</tt> function can
transparently parse a compressed document to produce an
<span class="structname">xmlDoc</span>. If we want to create a compressed
document with libxml we can use an
<span class="structname">xmlTextWriterPtr</span> (obtained through
<tt class="function">xmlNewTextWriterDoc</tt>), or another related
structure from <tt class="filename">libxml/xmlwriter.h</tt>, with
compression enabled.</p><p>XML allows documents to use a variety of different character
encodings. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv" target="_top">iconv</a> is a free
library for converting between different character encodings.  libxml
provides a set of default converters for some encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16
(little endian and big endian), ISO-8859-1, ASCII, and HTML (a
specific handler for the conversion of UTF-8 to ASCII with HTML
predefined entities like &amp;copy; for the copyright sign). However,
when compiled with iconv support, libxml and libxslt can handle the
full range of encodings provided by iconv; these should cover most
needs.</p><p>libxml and libxslt can be used in multi-threaded
applications. In MS-Windows they are linked against
<tt class="filename">MSVCRT.DLL</tt> (or one of its descendants, as we saw
<a href="#windows-build" title="MS-Windows Compiling and
Linking">above</a>). In *NIX the pthreads
(POSIX threads) library is used.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2839841"></a>The Complete Program</h2></div></div></div><p>

<h1 align="center">The XSLT C library for GNOME</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: center">libxslt</h1>

<p>Libxslt is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a> C library
developed for the GNOME project. XSLT itself is a an XML language to define
transformation for XML. Libxslt is based on <a
href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a> the XML C library developed for the
GNOME project. It also implements most of the <a
href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</a> set of processor-portable extensions
functions and some of Saxon's evaluate and expressions extensions.</p>

<p>People can either embed the library in their application or use xsltproc
the command line processing tool. This library is free software and can be
reused in commercial applications (see the <a href="intro.html">intro</a>)</p>

<h2><a name="Introducti">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This document describes <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">libxslt</a>,
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a> C library developed for the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> project.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about libxslt:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Libxslt is a C implementation</li>
  <li>Libxslt is based on libxml for XML parsing, tree manipulation and XPath
    support</li>
  <li>It is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as possible, and
    sticking closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding. Should works on
    Linux/Unix/Windows.</li>
  <li>This library is released under the <a
    href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT
  Licence</a></li>
  <li>Though not designed primarily with performances in mind, libxslt seems
    to be a relatively fast processor.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Documentat">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>There are some on-line resources about using libxslt:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the <a href="html/libxslt-lib.html#LIBXSLT-LIB">API
    documentation</a> automatically extracted from code comments (using the
    program apibuild.py, developed for libxml, together with the xsl script
    'newapi.xsl' and the libxslt xsltproc program).</li>
  <li>Look at the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xslt/">mailing-list
    archive</a>.</li>
  <li>Of course since libxslt is based on libxml, it's a good idea to at
    least read <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml description</a></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Reporting">Reporting bugs and getting help</a></h2>

<p>If you need help with the XSLT language itself, here are a number of
useful resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I strongly suggest to subscribe to <a
    href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list">XSL-list</a>, check <a
    href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/">the XSL-list
    archives</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/xslfaq.html">XSL FAQ</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a
    href="http://www.nwalsh.com/docs/tutorials/xsl/xsl/slides.html">tutorial</a>
    written by Paul Grosso and Norman Walsh is a very good on-line
    introdution to the language.</li>
  <li>The <a
    href="http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XSLTutorial/Books/Book1/index.html">only
    Zvon XSLT tutorial</a> details a lot of constructs with examples.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/index.html">Jeni Tennison's
    XSLT</a> pages provide links to a lot of answers</li>
  <li>the <a href="http://incrementaldevelopment.com/xsltrick/">Gallery of
    XSLT Tricks</a> provides non-standard use case of XSLT</li>
  <li>And I suggest to buy Michael Kay "XSLT Programmer's Reference" book
    published by <a href="http://www.wrox.com/">Wrox</a> if you plan to work
    seriously with XSLT in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, bugs or missing features are always possible, and I will make a
point of fixing them in a timely fashion. The best way to report a bug is to
use the <a
href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/issues">GNOME bug
tracking database</a> (make sure to use the "libxslt" module name). Before
filing a bug, check the <a
href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/issues">list of existing
libxslt bugs</a> to make sure it hasn't already been filed. I look at reports
there regularly and it's good to have a reminder when a bug is still open. Be
sure to specify that the bug is for the package libxslt.</p>

<p>For small problems you can try to get help on IRC, the #xml channel on
irc.gnome.org (port 6667) usually have a few person subscribed which may help
(but there is no guarantee and if a real issue is raised it should go on the
mailing-list for archival).</p>

<p>There is also a mailing-list <a
href="mailto:xslt@gnome.org">xslt@gnome.org</a> for libxslt, with an <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xslt/">on-line archive</a>. To subscribe
to this list, please visit the <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/xslt">associated Web</a> page
and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can just send the bug to the <a
href="mailto:xslt@gnome.org">xslt@gnome.org</a> list, if it's really libxslt
related I will approve it.. Please do not send me mail directly especially
for portability problem, it makes things really harder to track and in some
cases I'm not the best person to answer a given question, ask the list
instead. <strong>Do not send code, I won't debug it</strong> (but patches are
really appreciated!).</p>

<p>Please note that with the current amount of virus and SPAM, sending mail
to the list without being subscribed won't work. There is *far too many
bounces* (in the order of a thousand a day !) I cannot approve them manually
anymore. If your mail to the list bounced waiting for administrator approval,
it is LOST ! Repost it and fix the problem triggering the error. Also please
note that <span style="color: #FF0000; background-color: #FFFFFF">emails with
a legal warning asking to not copy or redistribute freely the information
they contain</span> are <strong>NOT</strong> acceptable for the mailing-list,
such mail will as much as possible be discarded automatically, and are less
likely to be answered if they made it to the list, <strong>DO NOT</strong>
post to the list from an email address where such legal requirements are
automatically added, get private paying support if you can't share
information.</p>

<p>Check the following too <span style="color: #E50000">before
posting</span>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="search.php">use the search engine</a> to get information
    related to your problem.</li>
  <li>make sure you are <a href="ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/">using a recent
    version</a>, and that the problem still shows up in those</li>
  <li>check the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xslt/">list
    archives</a> to see if the problem was reported already, in this case
    there is probably a fix available, similarly check the <a
    href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/issues">registered
    open bugs</a></li>
  <li>make sure you can reproduce the bug with xsltproc, a very useful thing
    to do is run the transformation with -v argument and redirect the
    standard error to a file, then search in this file for the transformation
    logs just preceding the possible problem</li>
  <li>Please send the command showing the error as well as the input and
    stylesheet (as an attachment)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then send the bug with associated information to reproduce it to the <a
href="mailto:xslt@gnome.org">xslt@gnome.org</a> list; if it's really libxslt
related I will approve it. Please do not send mail to me directly, it makes
things really hard to track and in some cases I am not the best person to
answer a given question, ask on the list.</p>

<p>To <span style="color: #E50000">be really clear about support</span>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support or help <span style="color: #E50000">request MUST be sent to
    the list or the bug tracker</span> in case of problems, so that the Question
    and Answers can be shared publicly. Failing to do so carries the implicit
    message "I want free support but I don't want to share the benefits with
    others" and is not welcome. I will automatically Carbon-Copy the
    xslt@gnome.org mailing list for any technical reply made about libxml2 or
    libxslt.</li>
  <li>There is <span style="color: #E50000">no guarantee for support</span>,
    if your question remains unanswered after a week, repost it, making sure
    you gave all the detail needed and the information requested.</li>
  <li>Failing to provide information as requested or double checking first
    for prior feedback also carries the implicit message "the time of the
    library maintainers is less valuable than my time" and might not be
    welcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, bugs reports with a suggested patch for fixing them will
probably be processed faster.</p>

<p>If you're looking for help, a quick look at <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xslt/">the list archive</a> may actually
provide the answer, I usually send source samples when answering libxslt
usage questions. The <a
href="html/libxslt-lib.html#LIBXSLT-LIB">auto-generated documentation</a> is
not as polished as I would like (I need to learn more about Docbook), but
it's a good starting point.</p>

<h2><a name="help">How to help</a></h2>

<p>You can help the project in various ways, the best thing to do first is to

<h2><a name="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li><em>Troubles compiling or linking programs using libxslt</em>
    <p>Usually the problem comes from the fact that the compiler doesn't get
    the right compilation or linking flags. There is a small shell script
    <code>xslt-config</code> which is installed as part of libxslt usual
    install process which provides those flags. Use</p>
    <p><code>xslt-config --cflags</code></p>
    <p>to get the compilation flags and</p>
    <p><code>xslt-config --libs</code></p>
    <p>to get the linker flags. Usually this is done directly from the
    Makefile as:</p>
    <p><code>CFLAGS=`xslt-config --cflags`</code></p>
    <p><code>LIBS=`xslt-config --libs`</code></p>
    <p>Note also that if you use the EXSLT extensions from the program then
    you should prepend <code>-lexslt</code> to the LIBS options</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>passing parameters on the xsltproc command line doesn't work</em>
    <p><em>xsltproc --param test alpha foo.xsl foo.xml</em></p>
    <p><em>the param does not get passed and ends up as ""</em></p>
    <p>In a nutshell do a double escaping at the shell prompt:</p>
    <p>xsltproc --param test "'alpha'" foo.xsl foo.xml</p>
    <p>i.e. the string value is surrounded by " and ' then terminated by '
    and ". Libxslt interpret the parameter values as XPath expressions, so
    the string -&gt;<code>alpha</code>&lt;- is intepreted as the node set
    matching this string. You really want -&gt;<code>'alpha'</code>&lt;- to
    be passed to the processor. And to allow this you need to escape the
    quotes at the shell level using -&gt;<code>"'alpha'"</code>&lt;- .</p>
    <p>or use</p>
    <p>xsltproc --stringparam test alpha foo.xsl foo.xml</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Is there C++ bindings ?</em>
    <p>Yes for example <a
    href="http://pmade.org/pjones/software/xmlwrapp/">xmlwrapp</a> , see <a
    href="python.html">the related pages about bindings</a></p>
