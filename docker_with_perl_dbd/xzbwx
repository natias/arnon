provided by John Lightsey to address this problem.  This vulnerability has
been reported as CVE-2017-6512.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

FATAL errors will cause the program to halt (C<croak>), since the
problem is so severe that it would be dangerous to continue. (This
can always be trapped with C<eval>, but it's not a good idea. Under
the circumstances, dying is the best thing to do).

SEVERE errors may be trapped using the modern interface. If the
they are not trapped, or if the old interface is used, such an error
will cause the program will halt.

All other errors may be trapped using the modern interface, otherwise
they will be C<carp>ed about. Program execution will not be halted.

=over 4

=item mkdir [path]: [errmsg] (SEVERE)

C<make_path> was unable to create the path. Probably some sort of
permissions error at the point of departure or insufficient resources
(such as free inodes on Unix).

=item No root path(s) specified

C<make_path> was not given any paths to create. This message is only
emitted if the routine is called with the traditional interface.
The modern interface will remain silent if given nothing to do.

=item No such file or directory

On Windows, if C<make_path> gives you this warning, it may mean that
you have exceeded your filesystem's maximum path length.

=item cannot fetch initial working directory: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> attempted to determine the initial directory by calling
C<Cwd::getcwd>, but the call failed for some reason. No attempt
will be made to delete anything.

=item cannot stat initial working directory: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> attempted to stat the initial directory (after having
successfully obtained its name via C<getcwd>), however, the call
failed for some reason. No attempt will be made to delete anything.

=item cannot chdir to [dir]: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> attempted to set the working directory in order to
begin deleting the objects therein, but was unsuccessful. This is
usually a permissions issue. The routine will continue to delete
other things, but this directory will be left intact.

=item directory [dir] changed before chdir, expected dev=[n] ino=[n], actual dev=[n] ino=[n], aborting. (FATAL)

C<remove_tree> recorded the device and inode of a directory, and then
moved into it. It then performed a C<stat> on the current directory
and detected that the device and inode were no longer the same. As
this is at the heart of the race condition problem, the program
will die at this point.

=item cannot make directory [dir] read+writeable: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> attempted to change the permissions on the current directory
to ensure that subsequent unlinkings would not run into problems,
but was unable to do so. The permissions remain as they were, and
the program will carry on, doing the best it can.

=item cannot read [dir]: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> tried to read the contents of the directory in order
to acquire the names of the directory entries to be unlinked, but
was unsuccessful. This is usually a permissions issue. The
program will continue, but the files in this directory will remain
after the call.

=item cannot reset chmod [dir]: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree>, after having deleted everything in a directory, attempted
to restore its permissions to the original state but failed. The
directory may wind up being left behind.

=item cannot remove [dir] when cwd is [dir]

The current working directory of the program is F</some/path/to/here>
and you are attempting to remove an ancestor, such as F</some/path>.
The directory tree is left untouched.

The solution is to C<chdir> out of the child directory to a place
outside the directory tree to be removed.

=item cannot chdir to [parent-dir] from [child-dir]: [errmsg], aborting. (FATAL)

C<remove_tree>, after having deleted everything and restored the permissions
of a directory, was unable to chdir back to the parent. The program
halts to avoid a race condition from occurring.

=item cannot stat prior working directory [dir]: [errmsg], aborting. (FATAL)

C<remove_tree> was unable to stat the parent directory after having returned
from the child. Since there is no way of knowing if we returned to
where we think we should be (by comparing device and inode) the only
way out is to C<croak>.

=item previous directory [parent-dir] changed before entering [child-dir], expected dev=[n] ino=[n], actual dev=[n] ino=[n], aborting. (FATAL)

When C<remove_tree> returned from deleting files in a child directory, a
check revealed that the parent directory it returned to wasn't the one
it started out from. This is considered a sign of malicious activity.

=item cannot make directory [dir] writeable: [errmsg]

Just before removing a directory (after having successfully removed
everything it contained), C<remove_tree> attempted to set the permissions
on the directory to ensure it could be removed and failed. Program
execution continues, but the directory may possibly not be deleted.

=item cannot remove directory [dir]: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> attempted to remove a directory, but failed. This may be because
some objects that were unable to be removed remain in the directory, or
it could be a permissions issue. The directory will be left behind.

=item cannot restore permissions of [dir] to [0nnn]: [errmsg]

After having failed to remove a directory, C<remove_tree> was unable to
restore its permissions from a permissive state back to a possibly
more restrictive setting. (Permissions given in octal).

=item cannot make file [file] writeable: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> attempted to force the permissions of a file to ensure it
could be deleted, but failed to do so. It will, however, still attempt
to unlink the file.

=item cannot unlink file [file]: [errmsg]

C<remove_tree> failed to remove a file. Probably a permissions issue.

=item cannot restore permissions of [file] to [0nnn]: [errmsg]

After having failed to remove a file, C<remove_tree> was also unable
to restore the permissions on the file to a possibly less permissive
setting. (Permissions given in octal).

=item unable to map [owner] to a uid, ownership not changed");

C<make_path> was instructed to give the ownership of created
directories to the symbolic name [owner], but C<getpwnam> did
not return the corresponding numeric uid. The directory will
be created, but ownership will not be changed.

=item unable to map [group] to a gid, group ownership not changed

C<make_path> was instructed to give the group ownership of created
directories to the symbolic name [group], but C<getgrnam> did
not return the corresponding numeric gid. The directory will
be created, but group ownership will not be changed.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item *

L<File::Remove>

Allows files and directories to be moved to the Trashcan/Recycle
Bin (where they may later be restored if necessary) if the operating
system supports such functionality. This feature may one day be
made available directly in C<File::Path>.

=item *

L<File::Find::Rule>

When removing directory trees, if you want to examine each file to
decide whether to delete it (and possibly leaving large swathes
alone), F<File::Find::Rule> offers a convenient and flexible approach
to examining directory trees.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The following describes F<File::Path> limitations and how to report bugs.

=head2 MULTITHREADED APPLICATIONS

F<File::Path> C<rmtree> and C<remove_tree> will not work with
multithreaded applications due to its use of C<chdir>.  At this time,
no warning or error is generated in this situation.  You will
certainly encounter unexpected results.

The implementation that surfaces this limitation will not be changed. See the
F<File::Path::Tiny> module for functionality similar to F<File::Path> but which does
not C<chdir>.

=head2 NFS Mount Points

F<File::Path> is not responsible for triggering the automounts, mirror mounts,
and the contents of network mounted filesystems.  If your NFS implementation
requires an action to be performed on the filesystem in order for
F<File::Path> to perform operations, it is strongly suggested you assure
filesystem availability by reading the root of the mounted filesystem.

=head2 REPORTING BUGS

Please report all bugs on the RT queue, either via the web interface:

L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=File-Path>

or by email:

    bug-File-Path@rt.cpan.org

In either case, please B<attach> patches to the bug report rather than
including them inline in the web post or the body of the email.

You can also send pull requests to the Github repository:

L<https://github.com/rpcme/File-Path>

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Paul Szabo identified the race condition originally, and Brendan
O'Dea wrote an implementation for Debian that addressed the problem.
That code was used as a basis for the current code. Their efforts
are greatly appreciated.

Gisle Aas made a number of improvements to the documentation for
2.07 and his advice and assistance is also greatly appreciated.

#pod formatting tool. Please skip straight to the SYNOPSIS section if you
#pod are not trying to port this module to a new platform.
#pod
#pod This module is designed to be portable across operating systems and it
#pod currently supports Unix, VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows and Mac OS
#pod (Classic). When porting to a new OS there are generally three main
#pod issues that have to be solved:
#pod
#pod =over 4
#pod
#pod =item *
#pod
#pod Can the OS unlink an open file? If it can not then the
#pod C<_can_unlink_opened_file> method should be modified.
#pod
#pod =item *
#pod
#pod Are the return values from C<stat> reliable? By default all the
#pod return values from C<stat> are compared when unlinking a temporary
#pod file using the filename and the handle. Operating systems other than
#pod unix do not always have valid entries in all fields. If utility function
#pod C<File::Temp::unlink0> fails then the C<stat> comparison should be
#pod modified accordingly.
#pod
#pod =item *
#pod
#pod Security. Systems that can not support a test for the sticky bit
#pod on a directory can not use the MEDIUM and HIGH security tests.
#pod The C<_can_do_level> method should be modified accordingly.

#pod
#pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
#pod
#pod C<File::Temp> can be used to create and open temporary files in a safe
#pod way.  There is both a function interface and an object-oriented
#pod interface.  The File::Temp constructor or the tempfile() function can
#pod be used to return the name and the open filehandle of a temporary
#pod file.  The tempdir() function can be used to create a temporary
#pod directory.
#pod
#pod The security aspect of temporary file creation is emphasized such that
#pod a filehandle and filename are returned together.  This helps guarantee
#pod that a race condition can not occur where the temporary file is
#pod created by another process between checking for the existence of the
#pod file and its opening.  Additional security levels are provided to
#pod check, for example, that the sticky bit is set on world writable
#pod directories.  See L<"safe_level"> for more information.
#pod
#pod For compatibility with popular C library functions, Perl implementations of
#pod the mkstemp() family of functions are provided. These are, mkstemp(),
#pod mkstemps(), mkdtemp() and mktemp().
#pod
#pod Additionally, implementations of the standard L<POSIX|POSIX>
#pod tmpnam() and tmpfile() functions are provided if required.
#pod
#pod Implementations of mktemp(), tmpnam(), and tempnam() are provided,
#pod but should be used with caution since they return only a filename
#pod that was valid when function was called, so cannot guarantee
#pod that the file will not exist by the time the caller opens the filename.
#pod
#pod Filehandles returned by these functions support the seekable methods.

# INTERNAL ROUTINES - not to be used outside of package

# Generic routine for getting a temporary filename
# modelled on OpenBSD _gettemp() in mktemp.c

# The template must contain X's that are to be replaced
# with the random values

#  Arguments:

#  TEMPLATE   - string containing the XXXXX's that is converted
#           to a random filename and opened if required

# Optionally, a hash can also be supplied containing specific options
#   "open" => if true open the temp file, else just return the name
#             default is 0
#   "mkdir"=> if true, we are creating a temp directory rather than tempfile
#             default is 0
#   "suffixlen" => number of characters at end of PATH to be ignored.
#                  default is 0.
#   "unlink_on_close" => indicates that, if possible,  the OS should remove
#                        the file as soon as it is closed. Usually indicates
#                        use of the O_TEMPORARY flag to sysopen.
#                        Usually irrelevant on unix
#   "use_exlock" => Indicates that O_EXLOCK should be used. Default is false.
#   "file_permissions" => file permissions for sysopen(). Default is 0600.

# Optionally a reference to a scalar can be passed into the function
# On error this will be used to store the reason for the error
#   "ErrStr"  => \$errstr

# "open" and "mkdir" can not both be true
# "unlink_on_close" is not used when "mkdir" is true.

# The default options are equivalent to mktemp().

# Returns:
#   filehandle - open file handle (if called with doopen=1, else undef)
#   temp name  - name of the temp file or directory

# For example:
#   ($fh, $name) = _gettemp($template, "open" => 1);

# for the current version, failures are associated with
# stored in an error string and returned to give the reason whilst debugging
