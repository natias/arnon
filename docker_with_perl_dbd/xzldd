=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email
to L<perlbug@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlapi>

=over 4

=item *

The API functions C<perl_parse()>, C<perl_run()>, and C<perl_destruct()>
are now documented comprehensively, where previously the only
documentation was a reference to the L<perlembed> tutorial.

=item *

The documentation of C<newGIVENOP()> has been belatedly updated to
account for the removal of lexical C<$_>.

=item *

The API functions C<newCONSTSUB()> and C<newCONSTSUB_flags()> are
documented much more comprehensively than before.

has been clarified.
L<[GH #16055]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16055>

=back

=head3 L<perldiag>

=over 4

=item * L<perldiag/Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex mE<sol>%sE<sol>>

This now gives more ideas as to workarounds to the issue that was
introduced in Perl 5.18 (but not documented explicitly in its perldelta)
for the fact that some Unicode C</i> rules cause a few sequences such as

 (?<!st)

to be considered variable length, and hence disallowed.

=item * "Use of state $_ is experimental" in L<perldiag>

This entry has been removed, as the experimental support of this construct was
removed in perl 5.24.0.

=item *

The diagnostic C<Initialization of state variables in list context
currently forbidden> has changed to C<Initialization of state variables
in list currently forbidden>, because list-context initialization of
single aggregate state variables is now permitted.

=back

=head3 L<perlembed>

=over 4

=item *

The examples in L<perlembed> have been made more portable in the way
they exit, and the example that gets an exit code from the embedded Perl
interpreter now gets it from the right place.  The examples that pass
a constructed argv to Perl now show the mandatory null C<argv[argc]>.

=item *

An example in L<perlembed> used the string value of C<ERRSV> as a
format string when calling croak().  If that string contains format
codes such as C<%s> this could crash the program.

This has been changed to a call to croak_sv().

An alternative could have been to supply a trivial format string:

  croak("%s", SvPV_nolen(ERRSV));

or as a special case for C<ERRSV> simply:

  croak(NULL);

L<perluniprops> has been updated to note that C<\p{Word}> now includes
code points matching the C<\p{Join_Control}> property.  The change to
the property was made in Perl 5.18, but not documented until now.  There
are currently only two code points that match this property U+200C (ZERO
WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER).

L<Can't "goto" into a "given" block|perldiag/"Can't E<quot>gotoE<quot> into a E<quot>givenE<quot> block">

=item *

L<Can't "goto" into a binary or list expression|perldiag/"Can't E<quot>gotoE<quot> into a binary or list expression">

Use of C<goto> to jump into the parameter of a binary or list operator has
been prohibited, to prevent crashes and stack corruption.
L<[GH #15914]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15914>

The warning about useless use of a concatenation operator in void context

C<$a.$b.$c>, which used to mistakenly not warn.
L<[GH #3990]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/3990>

=item *

Warnings that a variable or subroutine "masks earlier declaration in same

L<[GH #14662]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14662>

The L<perldiag> entry for the error regarding a set-id script has been

=item * C89 requirement

Perl has been documented as requiring a C89 compiler to build since October
1998.  A variety of simplifications have now been made to Perl's internals to
rely on the features specified by the C89 standard. We believe that this
internal change hasn't altered the set of platforms that Perl builds on, but
please report a bug if Perl now has new problems building on your platform.

=item *

On GCC, C<-Werror=pointer-arith> is now enabled by default,
disallowing arithmetic on void and function pointers.

Where an HTML version of the documentation is installed, the HTML
documents now use relative links to refer to each other.  Links from
the index page of L<perlipc> to the individual section documents are
now correct.
L<[GH #11941]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/11941>

=item *

F<lib/unicore/mktables> now correctly canonicalizes the names of the
dependencies stored in the files it generates.

F<regen/mk_invlists.pl>, unlike the other F<regen/*.pl> scripts, used
C<$0> to name itself in the dependencies stored in the files it
generates.  It now uses a literal so that the path stored in the
generated files doesn't depend on how F<regen/mk_invlists.pl> is
invoked.

This lack of canonical names could cause test failures in F<t/porting/regen.t>.
