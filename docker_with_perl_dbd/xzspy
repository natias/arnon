 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: Generic library support script
 This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
 the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
 libraries) behind a consistent interface.  To use libtool, add the
 new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in,
 or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for details.  Libtool supports
 building static libraries on all platforms.
 .
 Libtool supports generation of C, C++, Fortran and Java libraries.

Description: Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique

 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
