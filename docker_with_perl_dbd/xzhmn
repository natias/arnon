When using CTRL-T to jump within the same file, the '' mark wasn't set.

Undo wasn't Vi compatible when using the 'c' flag for ":s".  Now it undoes the
whole ":s" command instead of each confirmed replacement.

The Buffers menu, when torn-off, disappeared when being refreshed.  Add a
dummy item to avoid this.

Removed calling msg_start() in main(), it should not be needed.

vim_strpbrk() did not support multibyte characters. (Muraoka Taro)

The Amiga version didn't compile, the code was too big for relative jumps.
Moved a few files from ex_docmd.c to ex_cmds2.c

When evaluating the "= register resulted in the "= register being changed, Vim
would crash.

When doing ":view file" and it fails, the current buffer was made read-only.

Motif: For some people the separators in the toolbar disappeared when resizing
the Vim window. (Marcin Dalecki)

Win32 GUI: when setting 'lines' to a huge number, would not compute the
available space correctly.  Was counting the menu height twice.

Conversion of the docs to HTML didn't handle the line with the +quickfix tag
correctly. (Antonio Colombo)

Win32: fname_case() didn't handle multibyte characters correctly. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

The Cygwin version had trouble with fchdir().  Don't use that function for
Cygwin.

The generic check in scripts.vim for "conf" syntax was done before some checks
in filetype.vim, resulting in "conf" syntax too often.

Dos32: Typing lagged behind.  Would wait for one biostick when checking if a
character is available.

GTK: When setting 'columns' while starting up "gvim", would set the width of
the terminal it was started in.

When using ESC in Insert mode, an autoindent that wraps to the next line
caused the cursor to move to the end of the line temporarily.  When the
character before the cursor was a double-wide multibyte character the cursor
would be on the right half, which causes problems with some terminals.

Didn't handle multibyte characters correctly when expanding a file name.
(Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Win32 GUI: Errors generated before the GUI is decided to start were not
reported.

globpath() didn't reserve enough room for concatenated results. (Anduin
Withers)

When expanding an option that is very long already, don't do the expansion, it
would be truncated to MAXPATHL. (Anduin Withers)

When 'selection' is "exclusive", using "Fx" in Visual mode only moved until
just after the character.

When using IME on the console to enter a file name, the screen may scroll up.
Redraw the screen then. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Motif: In the find/replace dialog the "Replace" button didn't work first time,
second time it replaced all matches.  Removed the use of ":s///c".
GTK: Similar problems with the find/replace dialog, moved the code to a common
function.

X11: Use shared GC's for text. (Marcin Dalecki)

"]i" found the match under the cursor, instead of the first one below it.
Same for "]I", "] CTRL-I", "]d", "]D" and "] CTRL-D".

Win16: When maximized and the font is changed, don't change the window size.
(Vince Negri)

When 'lbr' is set, deleting a block of text could leave the cursor in the
wrong position.

Win32: When opening a file with the "Edit with Vim" popup menu entry,
wildcards would cause trouble.  Added the "--literal" argument to avoid
expanding file names.

When using "gv", it didn't restore that "$" was used in Visual block mode.

Win32 GUI: While waiting for a shell command to finish, the window wasn't
redrawn at all. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Syntax highlighting: A match that continues on a next line because of a
contained region didn't end when that region ended.

The ":s" command didn't allow flags like 'e' and 'i' right after it.

When using ":s" to split a line, marks were moved to the next line.  Vi keeps
them in the first line.

When using ":n" ":rew", the previous context mark was at the top of the file,
while Vi puts it in the same place as the cursor.  Made it Vi compatible.

Fixed Vi incompatibility: Text was not put in register 1 when using "c" and
"d" with a motion character, when deleting within one line with one of the
commands: % ( ) `<character> / ? N n { }

Win32 GUI: The tooltip for tear-off items remained when the tear-off item was
no longer selected.

GUI: When typing ":" at the more prompt, would return to Normal mode and not
redraw the screen.

When starting Vim with an argument "-c g/at/p" the printed lines would
overwrite each other.

BeOS: Didn't compile.  Configure didn't add the os_beos files, the QNX check
removed them.  Various changes to os_beos.cc. (Joshua Haberman)
Removed the check for the hardware platform, the BeBox has not been produced
for a long time now.

Win32 GUI: don't use a message box when the shell returns an error code,
display the message in the Vim window.

Make_mvc.mak always included "/debug" for linking.  "GUI=no" argument didn't
work.  Use "DEBUG=yes" instead of "DEBUG=1" to make it consistent. (Dan Sharp)

When a line in the tags file ended in ;" (no TAB following) the command would
not be recognized as a search command.

X11: The inputMethod resource never worked.  Don't use the "none" input method
for SGI, it apparently makes the first character in Input method dropped.

Fixed incorrect tests in os_mac.h. (Axel Kielhorn)

Win32 console: When the console where Vim runs in is closed, Vim could hang in
trying to restore the window icon. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

When using ":3call func()" or ":3,3call func() the line number was ignored.

When 'showbreak' and 'linebreak' were both set, Visual highlighting sometimes
continued until the end of the line.

GTK GUI: Tearoff items were added even when 'guioptions' didn't contain 't'
when starting up.

MS-Windows: When the current directory includes a "~", searching files with
"gf" or ":find" didn't work.  A "$" in the directory had the same problem.
Added mch_has_exp_wildcard() functions.

When reducing the Vim window height while starting up, would get an
out-of-memory error message.

When editing a very long search pattern, 'incsearch' caused the redraw of the
command line to fail.

Motif GUI: On some systems the "Help" menu would not be on the far right, as
it should be.  On some other systems (esp. IRIX) the command line would not
completely show.  Solution is to only resize the menubar for Lesstif.

Using "%" in a line that contains "\\" twice didn't take care of the quotes
properly.  Now make a difference between \" and \\".

For non-Unix systems a dummy file is created when finding a swap name to
detect a 8.3 filesystem.  When there is an existing swap file, would get a
warning for the file being created outside of Vim.  Also, when closing the Vim
window the file would remain.

Motif: The menu height was always computed, using a "-menuheight" argument
was setting the room for the command line.  Now make clear the argument is not
supported.

For some (EBCDIC) systems, POUND was equal to '#'.  Added an #if for that to
avoid a duplicate case in a switch.

The GUI may have problems when forking.  Always call _exit() instead of exit()
in the parent, the child will call exit().

Win32 GUI: Accented characters were often wrong in dialogs and tearoff menus.
Now use CP_ACP instead of CP_OEMCP. (Vince Negri)

When displaying text with syntax highlighting causes an error (e.g., running
out of stack) the syntax highlighting is disabled to avoid further messages.

When a command in a .vimrc or .gvimrc causes an ATTENTION prompt, and Vim was
started from the desktop (no place to display messages) it would hang.  Now
open the GUI window early to be able to display the messages and pop up the
dialog.

"r<CR>" on a multibyte character deleted only the first byte of the
character.  "3r<CR>" deleted three bytes instead of three characters.

When interrupting reading a file, Vi considers the buffer modified.  Added the
'i' flag in 'cpoptions' flag for this (we don't want it modified to be able to
do ":q").

When using an item in 'guicursor' that starts with a colon, Vim would get
stuck or crash.

When putting a file mark in a help file and later jumping back to it, the
options would not be set.  Extended the modeline in all help files to make
this work better.

When a modeline contained "::" the local option values would be printed.  Now
ignore it.

Some help files did not use a 8.3 names, which causes problems when using
MS-DOS unzip.  Renamed "multibyte.txt" to "mbyte.txt", "rightleft.txt" to
"rileft.txt", "tagsearch.txt" to "tagsrch.txt", "os_riscos.txt" to
"os_risc.txt".

When Visual mode is blockwise, using "iw" or "aw" made it characterwise.  That
doesn't seem right, only do this when in linewise mode.  But then do it
always, not only when start and end of Visual mode are equal.

When using "viw" on a single-letter word and 'selection' is exclusive, would
not include the word.

When formatting text from Insert mode, using CTRL-O, could mess up undo
information.

While writing a file (also for the backup file) there was no check for an
interrupt (hitting CTRL-C).  Vim could hang when writing a large file over a
slow network, and moving the mouse didn't make it appear (when 'mousehide' is
set) and the screen wasn't updated in the GUI.  Also allow interrupting when
syncing the swap file, it can take a long time.

When using ":mksession" while there is help window, it would later be restored
to the right file but not marked as a help buffer.  ":help" would then open
another window.  Now use the value "help" for 'buftype' to mark a help buffer.

The session file contained absolute path names in option values, that doesn't
work when the home directory depends on the situation.  Replace the home
directory with ~/ when possible.

When using 'showbreak' a TAB just after the shown break would not be counted
correctly, the cursor would be positioned wrong.

With 'showbreak' set to "--->" or "------->" and 'sts' set to 4, inserting
tabs did not work right.  Could cause a crash.  Backspacing was also wrong,
could get stuck at a line break.

Win32: crashed when tearing off a menu with over 300 items.

GUI: A menu or toolbar item would appear when only a tooltip was defined for
it.

When 'scrolloff' is non-zero and "$" is in 'cpoptions', using "s" while the
last line of the file is the first line on screen, the text wasn't displayed.

When running "autoconf", delete the configure cache to force starting cleanly
when configure is run again.

When changing the Normal colors for cterm, the value of 'background' was
changed even when the GUI was used.

The warning for a missing vimrun.exe was always given on startup, but some
people just editing a file don't need to be bothered by it.  Only show it when
vimrun would be used.

When using "%" in a multibyte text it could get confused by trailbytes that
match. (Muraoka Taro)

Termcap entry for RiscOS was wrong, using 7 and 8 in octal codes.

Athena: The title of a dialog window and the file selector window were not
set. (David Harrison)

The "htmlLink" highlight group specified colors, which gives problems when
using a color scheme.  Added the "Underlined" highlight group for this.

After using ":insert" or ":change" the '[ mark would be one line too low.

When looking for the file name after a match with 'include' one character was
skipped.  Same for 'define'.

Win32 and DJGPP: When editing a file with a short name in a directory, and
editing the same file but using the long name, would end up with two buffers
on the same file.

"gf" on a filename that starts with "../" only worked when the file being
edited is in the current directory.  An include file search didn't work
properly for files starting with "../" or ".".  Now search both relative to
the file and to the current directory.

When 'printheader', 'titlestring', 'iconstring', 'rulerformat' or 'statusline'
contained "%{" but no following "}" memory was corrupted and a crash could
happen.

":0append" and then inserting two lines did not redraw the blank lines that
were scrolled back down.

When using insert mode completion in a narrow window, the message caused a
scroll up.  Now shorten the message if it doesn't fit and avoid writing the
ruler over the message.

XIM still didn't work correctly on some systems, especially SGI/IRIX.  Added
the 'imdisable' option, which is set by default for that system.

Patch 6.0aw.008
Problem:    When the first character of a file name is over 127, the Buffers
	    menu entry would get a negative priority and cause problems.
Solution:   Reduce the multiplier for the first character when computing
	    the hash value for a Buffers menu entry.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0aw.010
Problem:    Win32: ":browse edit dir/dir" didn't work. (Vikas)
Solution:   Change slashes to backslashes in the directory passed to the file
	    browser.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Athena file browser: On some systems wcstombs() can't be used to get the
length of a multibyte string.  Use the maximum length then. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

Patch 6.0ax.001
Problem:    When 'patchmode' is set, appending to a file gives an empty
	    original file. (Ed Ralston)
Solution:   Also make a backup copy when appending and 'patchmode' is set.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.0ax.002
Problem:    When 'patchmode' is set, appending to a compressed file gives an
	    uncompressed original file. (Ed Ralston)
Solution:   Create the original file before decompressing.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/gzip.vim

Patch 6.0ax.005
Problem:    Athena file selector keeps the title of the first invocation.
Solution:   Set the title each time the file selector is opened. (David
	    Harrison)
Files:	    src/gui_at_fs.c

Patch 6.0ax.007
Problem:    When using GPM (mouse driver in a Linux console) a double click is
	    interpreted as a scroll wheel click.
Solution:   Check if GPM is being used when deciding if a mouse event is for
	    the scroll wheel.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 6.0ax.010
Problem:    The Edit.Save menu and the Save toolbar button didn't work when
	    the buffer has no file name.
Solution:   Use a file browser to ask for a file name.  Also fix the toolbar
	    Find item in Visual mode.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0ax.012
Problem:    When 'cpoptions' contains "$", breaking a line for 'textwidth'
	    doesn't redraw properly. (Stefan Schulze)
Solution:   Remove the dollar before breaking the line.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.0ax.014
Problem:    Win32: On Windows 98 ":make -f file" doesn't work when 'shell' is
	    "command.com" and 'makeprg' is "nmake".  The environment isn't
	    passed on to "nmake".
Solution:   Also use vimrun.exe when redirecting the output of a command.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.0ax.016
Problem:    The version number was reported wrong in the intro screen.
Solution:   Check for a version number with two additional letters.
Files:	    src/version.c

Patch 6.0ax.019
Problem:    When scrolling a window with folds upwards, switching to another
	    vertically split window and back may not update the scrollbar.
Solution:   Limit w_botline to the number of lines in the buffer plus one.
Files:	    src/move.c

cp1250 version of the Slovak message translations.

Compiler plugins for IRIX compilers. (David Harrison)


Fixed							*fixed-6.1*
-----

The license text was updated to make the meaning clearer and make it
compatible with the GNU GPL.  Otherwise distributors have a problem when
linking Vim with a GPL'ed library.

When installing the "less.sh" script it was not made executable. (Chuck Berg)

Win32: The "9" key on the numpad wasn't working. (Julian Kinraid)

The NSIS install script didn't work with NSIS 1.80 or later.  Also add
Vim-specific icons. (Pruchnik)

The script for conversion to HTML contained an "if" in the wrong place.
(Michael Geddes)

Allow using ":ascii" in the sandbox, it's harmless.

Removed creat() from osdef2.h.in, it wasn't used and may cause a problem when
it's redefined to creat64().

The text files in the VisVim directory were in "dos" format.  This caused
problems when applying a patch.  Now keep them in "unix" format and convert
them to "dos" format only for the PC archives.

Add ruby files to the dos source archive, they can be used by Make_mvc.mak.
(Mirek Pruchnik)

"cp -f" doesn't work on all systems.  Change "cp -f" in the Makefile to "rm
-f" and "cp".

Didn't compile on a Compaq Tandem Himalaya OSS. (Michael A. Benzinger)

The GTK file selection dialog didn't include the "Create Dir", "Delete File"
and "Rename File" buttons.

When doing ":browse source" the dialog has the title "Run Macro".  Better
would be "Source Vim script". (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: Don't use the printer font as default for the font dialog.

"make doslang" didn't work when configure didn't run (yet).  Set $MAKEMO to
"yes". (Mirek Pruchnik)

The ToolBar TagJump item used "g]", which prompts for a selection even when
there is only one matching tag.  Use "g<C-]>" instead.

The ming makefile for message translations didn't have the right list of
files.

The MS-Windows 3.1 version complains about LIBINTL.DLL not found.  Compile
this version without message translations.

The Borland 5 makefile contained a check for Ruby which is no longer needed.
The URLs for the TCL library was outdated. (Dan Sharp)

The eviso.ps file was missing from the DOS runtime archive, it's needed for
printing PostScript in the 32bit DOS version.

In menu files ":scriptencoding" was used in a wrong way after patch 6.1a.032
Now use ":scriptencoding" in the file where the translations are given.  Do
the same for all menus in latin1 encoding.

Included a lot of fixes for the Macintosh, mostly to make it work with Carbon.
(Dany StAmant, Axel Kielhorn, Benji Fisher)

Improved the vimtutor shell script to use $TMPDIR when it exists, and delete
the copied file when exiting in an abnormal way. (Max Ischenko)

When "iconv.dll" can't be found, try using "libiconv.dll".

When encryption is used, filtering with a shell command wasn't possible.

DJGPP: ":cd c:" always failed, can't get permissions for "c:".
Win32: ":cd c:/" failed if the previous current directory on c: had become
invalid.

DJGPP: Shift-Del and Del both produce \316\123.  Default mapping for Del is
wrong.  Disabled it.

Dependencies on header files in MingW makefile was wrong.

Win32: Don't use ACL stuff for MSVC 4.2, it's not supported. (Walter Briscoe)

Win32 with Borland: bcc.cfg was caching the value for $(BOR), but providing a
different argument to make didn't regenerate it.

Win32 with MSVC: Make_ivc.mak generates a new if_ole.h in a different
directory, the if_ole.h in the src directory may be used instead.  Delete the
distributed file.

When a window is vertically split and then ":ball" is used, the window layout
is messed up, can cause a crash. (Muraoka Taro)

When 'insertmode' is set, using File/New menu and then double clicking, "i" is
soon inserted. (Merlin Hansen)

When Select mode is active and using the Buffers menu to switch to another
buffer, an old selection comes back.  Reset VIsual_reselect for a ":buffer"
command.

When Select mode is active and 'insertmode' is set, using the Buffers menu to
switch to another buffer, did not return to Insert mode.  Make sure
"restart_edit" is set.

When double clicking on the first character of a word while 'selection' is
"exclusive" didn't select that word.


Patch 6.0.001
Problem:    Loading the sh.vim syntax file causes error messages. (Corinna
	    Vinschen)
Solution:   Add an "if". (Charles Campbell)

Files:	    src/configure.in, src/auto/configure

Patch 6.0.004
Problem:    The find/replace dialog doesn't reuse a previous argument
	    properly.
Solution:   After removing a "\V" terminate the string. (Zwane Mwaikambo)
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.0.005
Problem:    In Insert mode, "CTRL-O :ls" has a delay before redrawing.
Solution:   Don't delay just after wait_return() was called.  Added the
	    did_wait_return flag.
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/message.c, src/normal.c, src/screen.c

Patch 6.0.006
Problem:    With a vertical split, 'number' set and 'scrolloff' non-zero,
	    making the window width very small causes a crash. (Niklas
	    Lindstrom)
Solution:   Check for a zero width.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.0.007
Problem:    When setting 'filetype' while there is no FileType autocommand, a
	    following ":setfiletype" would set 'filetype' again. (Kobus
	    Retief)
Solution:   Set did_filetype always when 'filetype' has been set.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.0.008
Problem:    'imdisable' is missing from the options window. (Michael Naumann)
Solution:   Add an entry for it.
Files:	    runtime/optwin.vim

Patch 6.0.009

Solution:   Define S_ISBLK using S_IFBLK.
Files:	    src/os_unix.h

Patch 6.0.010
Problem:    Using "gf" on a file name starting with "./" or "../" in a buffer
	    without a name causes a crash. (Roy Lewis)
Solution:   Check for a NULL file name.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.0.011
Problem:    Python: After replacing or deleting lines get an ml_get error.
	    (Leo Lipelis)
Solution:   Adjust the cursor position for deleted or added lines.
Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 6.0.012
Problem:    Polish translations contain printf format errors, this can result
	    in a crash when using one of them.
Solution:   Fix for translated messages. (Michal Politowski)
Files:	    src/po/pl.po

Patch 6.0.013
Problem:    Using ":silent! cmd" still gives some error messages, like for an
	    invalid range. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Reset emsg_silent after calling emsg() in do_one_cmd().
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.0.014
Problem:    When 'modifiable' is off and 'virtualedit' is "all", "rx" on a TAB
	    still changes the buffer. (Muraoka Taro)
Solution:   Check if saving the line for undo fails.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.015
Problem:    When 'cpoptions' includes "S" and "filetype plugin on" has been
	    used, can get an error for deleting the b:did_ftplugin variable.
	    (Ralph Henderson)
Solution:   Only delete the variable when it exists.
Files:	    runtime/ftplugin.vim

Patch 6.0.016
Problem:    bufnr(), bufname() and bufwinnr() don't find unlisted buffers when
	    the argument is a string. (Hari Krishna Dara)
	    Also for setbufvar() and getbufvar().
Solution:   Also find unlisted buffers.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.0.017
Problem:    When 'ttybuiltin' is set and a builtin termcap entry defines t_Co
	    and the external one doesn't, it gets reset to empty. (David
	    Harrison)
Solution:   Only set t_Co when it wasn't set yet.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 6.0.018
Problem:    Initializing 'encoding' may cause a crash when setlocale() is not
	    used. (Dany St-Amant)
Solution:   Check for a NULL pointer.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.0.019
Problem:    Converting a string with multibyte characters to a printable
	    string, e.g., with strtrans(), may cause a crash. (Tomas Zellerin)
Solution:   Correctly compute the length of the result in transstr().
Files:	    src/charset.c

Patch 6.0.020
Problem:    When obtaining the value of a global variable internally, could
	    get the function-local value instead.  Applies to using <Leader>
	    and <LocalLeader> and resetting highlighting in a function.
Solution:   Prepend "g:" to the variable name. (Aric Blumer)
Files:	    src/syntax.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.0.021
Problem:    The 'cscopepathcomp' option didn't work.
Solution:   Change USE_CSCOPE to FEAT_CSCOPE. (Mark Feng)
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.0.022
Problem:    When using the 'langmap' option, the second character of a command
	    starting with "g" isn't adjusted.
Solution:   Apply 'langmap' to the second character. (Alex Kapranoff)
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.023
Problem:    Loading the lhaskell syntax doesn't work. (Thore B. Karlsen)

Files:	    runtime/syntax/lhaskell.vim

Patch 6.0.024
Problem:    Using "CTRL-V u 9900" in Insert mode may cause a crash. (Noah
	    Levitt)
Solution:   Don't insert a NUL byte in the text, use a newline.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.0.025
Problem:    The pattern "\vx(.|$)" doesn't match "x" at the end of a line.
	    (Preben Peppe Guldberg)
Solution:   Always see a "$" as end-of-line after "\v".  Do the same for "^".
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.026
Problem:    GTK: When using arrow keys to navigate through the menus, the
	    separators are selected.
Solution:   Set the separators "insensitive". (Pavel Kankovsky)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.0.027
Problem:    VMS: Printing doesn't work, the file is deleted too quickly.
	    No longer need the VMS specific printing menu.
	    gethostname() is not available with VAXC.
	    The makefile was lacking selection of the tiny-huge feature set.
Solution:   Adjust the 'printexpr' option default.  Fix the other problems and
	    update the documentation.  (Zoltan Arpadffy)
Files:	    runtime/doc/os_vms.txt, runtime/menu.vim, src/INSTALLvms.txt,
	    src/Make_vms.mms, src/option.c, src/os_unix.c, src/os_vms_conf.h

Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.029
Problem:    When making a change in line 1, then in line 2 and then deleting
	    line 1, undo info could be wrong.  Only when the changes are undone
	    at once. (Gerhard Hochholzer)
Solution:   When not saving a line for undo because it was already done
	    before, remember for which entry the last line must be computed.
	    Added ue_getbot_entry pointer for this.  When the number of lines
	    changes, adjust the position of newer undo entries.
Files:	    src/structs.h, src/undo.c

Patch 6.0.030
Problem:    Using ":source! file" doesn't work inside a loop or after
	    ":argdo". (Pavol Juhas)
Solution:   Execute the commands in the file right away, do not let the main
	    loop do it.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/getchar.c, src/globals.h,
	    src/proto/ex_docmd.pro, src/proto/getchar.pro

Files:	    src/misc2.c, src/pty.c

Patch 6.0.032
Problem:    When changing a setting that affects all folds, they are not
	    displayed immediately.
Solution:   Set the redraw flag in foldUpdateAll().
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.0.033
Problem:    Using 'wildmenu' on MS-Windows, file names that include a space
	    are only displayed starting with that space. (Xie Yuheng)
Solution:   Don't recognize a backslash before a space as a path separator.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.0.034
Problem:    Calling searchpair() with three arguments could result in a crash
	    or strange error message. (Kalle Bjorklid)
Solution:   Don't use the fifth argument when there is no fourth argument.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.0.035
Problem:    The menu item Edit/Global_Settings/Toggle_Toolbar doesn't work
	    when 'ignorecase' is set. (Allen Castaban)
Solution:   Always match case when checking if a flag is already present in
	    'guioptions'.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.036
Problem:    OS/2, MS-DOS and MS-Windows: Using a path that starts with a
	    slash in 'tags' doesn't work as expected. (Mathias Koehrer)
Solution:   Only use the drive, not the whole path to the current directory.
	    Also make it work for "c:dir/file".
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.0.037
Problem:    When the user has set "did_install_syntax_menu" to avoid the
	    default Syntax menu it still appears. (Virgilio)
Solution:   Don't add the three default items when "did_install_syntax_menu"
	    is set.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.038
Problem:    When 'selection' is "exclusive", deleting a block of text at the
	    end of a line can leave the cursor beyond the end of the line.
Solution:   Correct the cursor position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.039
Problem:    "gP" leaves the cursor in the wrong position when 'virtualedit' is
	    used.  Using "c" in blockwise Visual mode leaves the cursor in a
	    strange position.
Solution:   For "gP" reset the "coladd" field for the '] mark.  For "c" leave
	    the cursor on the last inserted character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.040
Problem:    When 'fileencoding' is invalid and writing fails because of
	    this, the original file is gone. (Eric Carlier)

Solution:   Escape special characters in file names with a backslash.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.0.043
Problem:    Patch 6.0.041 was wrong.
Solution:   Use mch_getenv() instead of vim_getenv().
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.0.044
Problem:    Using a "containedin" list for a syntax item doesn't work for an
	    item that doesn't have a "contains" argument.  Also, "containedin"
	    doesn't ignore a transparent item. (Timo Frenay)
Solution:   When there is a "containedin" argument somewhere, always check for
	    contained items.  Don't check for the transparent item but the
	    item it's contained in.
Files:	    src/structs.h, src/syntax.c

Patch 6.0.045
Problem:    After creating a fold with a Visual selection, another window
	    with the same buffer still has inverted text. (Sami Salonen)
Solution:   Redraw the inverted text.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.046
Problem:    When getrlimit() returns an 8 byte number the check for running

Problem:    Using a regexp with "\(\)" inside a "\%[]" item causes a crash.
	    (Samuel Lacas)
Solution:   Don't allow nested atoms inside "\%[]".
Files:	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.0.048
Problem:    Win32: In the console the mouse doesn't always work correctly.
	    Sometimes after getting focus a mouse movement is interpreted like
	    a button click.
Solution:   Use a different function to obtain the number of mouse buttons.
	    Avoid recognizing a button press from undefined bits. (Vince Negri)
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.0.049
Problem:    When using evim the intro screen is misleading. (Adrian Nagle)
Solution:   Mention whether 'insertmode' is set and the menus to be used.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, src/version.c

Patch 6.0.050
Problem:    UTF-8: "viw" doesn't include non-ASCII characters before the
	    cursor. (Bertilo Wennergren)
Solution:   Use dec_cursor() instead of decrementing the column number.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.0.051
Problem:    UTF-8: Using CTRL-R on the command line doesn't insert composing
	    characters. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Also include the composing characters and fix redrawing them.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.052
Problem:    The check for rlim_t in patch 6.0.046 does not work on some
	    systems. (Zdenek Sekera)
Solution:   Also look in sys/resource.h for rlim_t.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.0.053 (extra)
Problem:    Various problems with QNX.
Solution:   Minor fix for configure.  Switch on terminal clipboard support in
	    main.c.  Fix "pterm" mouse support.  os_qnx.c didn't build without
	    photon. (Julian Kinraid)
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/gui_photon.c,
	    src/main.c, src/misc2.c, src/option.h, src/os_qnx.c, src/os_qnx.h,
	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.0.054
Problem:    When using mswin.vim, CTRL-V pastes a block of text like it is
	    normal text.  Using CTRL-V in blockwise Visual mode leaves "x"
	    characters behind.
Solution:   Make CTRL-V work as it should.  Do the same for the Paste menu
	    entries.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim, runtime/mswin.vim

Patch 6.0.055
Problem:    GTK: The selection isn't copied the first time.
Solution:   Own the selection at the right moment.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.0.056
Problem:    Using "CTRL-O cw" in Insert mode results in a nested Insert mode.
	    <Esc> doesn't leave Insert mode then.
Solution:   Only use nested Insert mode when 'insertmode' is set or when a
	    mapping is used.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.0.057
Problem:    Using ":wincmd g}" in a function doesn't work.  (Gary Holloway)
Solution:   Execute the command directly, instead of putting it in the
	    typeahead buffer.
Files:	    src/normal.c, src/proto/normal.pro, src/window.c

Patch 6.0.058
Problem:    When a Cursorhold autocommand moved the cursor, the ruler wasn't
	    updated. (Bohdan Vlasyuk)
Solution:   Update the ruler after executing the autocommands.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.0.059
Problem:    Highlighting for 'hlsearch' isn't visible in lines that are
	    highlighted for diff highlighting.  (Gary Holloway)
Solution:   Let 'hlsearch' highlighting overrule diff highlighting.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.0.060
Problem:    Motif: When the tooltip is to be popped up, Vim crashes.
	    (Gary Holloway)
Solution:   Check for a NULL return value from gui_motif_fontset2fontlist().
Files:	    src/gui_beval.c

Patch 6.0.061
Problem:    The toolbar buttons to load and save a session do not correctly
	    use v:this_session.
Solution:   Check for v:this_session to be empty instead of existing.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.0.062
Problem:    Crash when 'verbose' is > 3 and using ":shell". (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)
Solution:   Avoid giving a NULL pointer to printf().  Also output a newline
	    and switch the cursor on.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.0.063
Problem:    When 'cpoptions' includes "$", using "cw" to type a ')' on top of
	    the "$" doesn't update syntax highlighting after it.
Solution:   Stop displaying the "$" when typing a ')' in its position.
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.0.064 (extra)
Problem:    The NSIS install script doesn't work with newer versions of NSIS.
	    The diff feature doesn't work when there isn't a good diff.exe on
	    the system.
Solution:   Replace the GetParentDir instruction by a user function.
	    Fix a few cosmetic problems.  Use defined constants for the
	    version number, so that it's defined in one place only.
	    Only accept the install directory when it ends in "vim".
	    (Eduardo Fernandez)
	    Add a diff.exe and use it from the default _vimrc.
Files:	    nsis/gvim.nsi, nsis/README.txt, src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.0.065
Problem:    When using ":normal" in 'indentexpr' it may use redo characters
	    before its argument.  (Neil Bird)
Solution:   Save and restore the stuff buffer in ex_normal().
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/getchar.c, src/globals.h, src/structs.h

Patch 6.0.066
Problem:    Sometimes undo for one command is split into two undo actions.
	    (Halim Salman)
Solution:   Don't set the undo-synced flag when reusing a line that was
	    already saved for undo.
Files:	    src/undo.c

Patch 6.0.067
Problem:    if_xcmdsrv.c doesn't compile on systems where fd_set isn't defined
	    in the usual header file (e.g., AIX). (Mark Waggoner)
Solution:   Include sys/select.h in if_xcmdsrv.c for systems that have it.
Files:	    src/if_xcmdsrv.c

Patch 6.0.068
Problem:    When formatting a Visually selected area with "gq" and the number
	    of lines increases the last line may not be redrawn correctly.
	    (Yegappan Lakshmanan)
Solution:   Correct the area to be redrawn for inserted/deleted lines.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.0.069
Problem:    Using "K" on a word that includes a "!" causes a "No previous
	    command" error, because the "!" is expanded. (Craig Jeffries)
Solution:   Put a backslash before the "!".
