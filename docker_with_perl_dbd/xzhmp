Solution:   Go to end of the fold before counting context lines.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.1b.029
Problem:    Win32: When a directory on an NTFS partition is read/execute (no
	    delete,modify,write) and the file has modify rights, trying to
	    write the file deletes it.  Making the file read/write/execute
	    (not delete) solves it. (Mark Canup)

Patch 6.1b.033
Problem:    When using a count after a ":s" command may get ml_get errors.
	    (Dietmar Lang)
Solution:   Check that the resulting range does not go past the end of the
	    buffer.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.1b.034
Problem:    After sourcing mswin.vim, when using <C-S-Right> after

==============================================================================
VERSION 6.2						*version-6.2*

This section is about improvements made between version 6.1 and 6.2.

This is mainly a bug-fix release.  There are also a few new features.

Main new features:
- Support for GTK 2. (Daniel Elstner)
- Support for editing Arabic text. (Nadim Shaikli & Isam Bayazidi)
- ":try" command and exception handling. (Servatius Brandt)
- Support for the neXtaw GUI toolkit (mostly like Athena). (Alexey Froloff)
- Cscope support for Win32. (Khorev Sergey)
- Support for PostScript printing in various 8-bit encodings. (Mike Williams)


Changed							*changed-6.2*
-------

Removed the scheme indent file, the internal Lisp indenting works well now.

Moved the GvimEXt, OleVim and VisVim directories into the "src" directory.
This is more consistent with how xxd is handled.

The VisVim.dll file is installed in the top directory, next to gvimext.dll,
instead of in a subdirectory "VisVim".  Fixes that NSIS was uninstalling it
from the wrong directory.

Removed the art indent file, it didn't do anything.

submatch() returned line breaks with CR instead of LF.

Changed the Win32 Makefiles to become more uniform and compile gvimext.dll.
(Dan Sharp)

'cindent': Align a "//" comment with a "//" comment in a previous line.
(Helmut Stiegler)

Previously only for xterm-like terminals parent widgets were followed to find
the title and icon label.  Now do this for all terminal emulators.

Made it possible to recognize backslashes for "%" matching.  The 'M' flag in
'cpoptions' disables it. (Haakon Riiser)

Removed the Make_tcc.mak makefile for Turbo C.  It didn't work and we probably
can't make it work (the compiler runs out of memory).

Even though the documentation refers to keywords, "[ CTRL-D" was using
'isident' to find matches.  Changed it to use 'iskeyword'.  Also applies to
other commands that search for defined words in included files such as
":dsearch", "[D" and "[d".

Made 'keywordprg' global-local. (Christian Robinson)

Enabled the Netbeans interface by default.  Reversed the configure argument
from "--enable-netbeans" to "--disable-netbeans".
