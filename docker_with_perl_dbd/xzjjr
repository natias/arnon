#pod
#pod Useful functions for dealing with the filehandle and filename.
#pod
#pod =over 4
#pod
#pod =item B<unlink0>
#pod
#pod Given an open filehandle and the associated filename, make a safe
#pod unlink. This is achieved by first checking that the filename and
#pod filehandle initially point to the same file and that the number of
#pod links to the file is 1 (all fields returned by stat() are compared).
#pod Then the filename is unlinked and the filehandle checked once again to
#pod verify that the number of links on that file is now 0.  This is the
#pod closest you can come to making sure that the filename unlinked was the
#pod same as the file whose descriptor you hold.
#pod
#pod   unlink0($fh, $path)
#pod      or die "Error unlinking file $path safely";
#pod
#pod Returns false on error but croaks() if there is a security
#pod anomaly. The filehandle is not closed since on some occasions this is
#pod not required.
#pod
#pod On some platforms, for example Windows NT, it is not possible to
#pod unlink an open file (the file must be closed first). On those
#pod platforms, the actual unlinking is deferred until the program ends and
#pod good status is returned. A check is still performed to make sure that
#pod the filehandle and filename are pointing to the same thing (but not at
#pod the time the end block is executed since the deferred removal may not
#pod have access to the filehandle).
#pod
#pod Additionally, on Windows NT not all the fields returned by stat() can
#pod be compared. For example, the C<dev> and C<rdev> fields seem to be
#pod different.  Also, it seems that the size of the file returned by stat()
#pod does not always agree, with C<stat(FH)> being more accurate than
#pod C<stat(filename)>, presumably because of caching issues even when
#pod using autoflush (this is usually overcome by waiting a while after
#pod writing to the tempfile before attempting to C<unlink0> it).
#pod
#pod Finally, on NFS file systems the link count of the file handle does
#pod not always go to zero immediately after unlinking. Currently, this
#pod command is expected to fail on NFS disks.
#pod
#pod This function is disabled if the global variable $KEEP_ALL is true
#pod and an unlink on open file is supported. If the unlink is to be deferred
#pod to the END block, the file is still registered for removal.

#pod interface since the it will interfere with the object destructor deleting
#pod the file.

#pod
#pod =item STANDARD
#pod
#pod Do the basic security measures to ensure the directory exists and is
#pod writable, that temporary files are opened only if they do not already
#pod exist, and that possible race conditions are avoided.  Finally the
#pod L<unlink0|"unlink0"> function is used to remove files safely.
#pod
#pod =item MEDIUM
#pod
#pod In addition to the STANDARD security, the output directory is checked

#pod
#pod In addition to the MEDIUM security checks, also check for the
#pod possibility of ``chown() giveaway'' using the L<POSIX|POSIX>
#pod sysconf() function. If this is a possibility, each directory in the
#pod path is checked in turn for safeness, recursively walking back to the
#pod root directory.

#pod
#pod For maximum security, endeavour always to avoid ever looking at,

#pod you have, and attempts to check this can only trigger more race
#pod conditions.  It's far more secure to use the filehandle alone and
#pod dispense with the filename altogether.
#pod
#pod If you need to pass the handle to something that expects a filename
#pod then on a unix system you can use C<"/dev/fd/" . fileno($fh)> for
#pod arbitrary programs. Perl code that uses the 2-argument version of
#pod C<< open >> can be passed C<< "+<=&" . fileno($fh) >>. Otherwise you
#pod will need to pass the filename. You will have to clear the
#pod close-on-exec bit on that file descriptor before passing it to another
#pod process.

#pod =head2 Temporary files and NFS
#pod
#pod Some problems are associated with using temporary files that reside
#pod on NFS file systems and it is recommended that a local filesystem
#pod is used whenever possible. Some of the security tests will most probably
#pod fail when the temp file is not local. Additionally, be aware that
#pod the performance of I/O operations over NFS will not be as good as for
#pod a local disk.
#pod
#pod =head2 Forking
#pod
#pod In some cases files created by File::Temp are removed from within an
#pod END block. Since END blocks are triggered when a child process exits
#pod (unless C<POSIX::_exit()> is used by the child) File::Temp takes care
#pod to only remove those temp files created by a particular process ID. This
#pod means that a child will not attempt to remove temp files created by the
#pod parent process.
#pod
#pod If you are forking many processes in parallel that are all creating
#pod temporary files, you may need to reset the random number seed using
#pod srand(EXPR) in each child else all the children will attempt to walk
#pod through the same set of random file names and may well cause
#pod themselves to give up if they exceed the number of retry attempts.
#pod
#pod =head2 Directory removal
#pod
#pod Note that if you have chdir'ed into the temporary directory and it is
#pod subsequently cleaned up (either in the END block or as part of object
#pod destruction), then you will get a warning from File::Path::rmtree().
#pod
#pod =head2 Taint mode
#pod
#pod If you need to run code under taint mode, updating to the latest
#pod L<File::Spec> is highly recommended.  On Windows, if the directory
#pod given by L<File::Spec::tmpdir> isn't writable, File::Temp will attempt
#pod to fallback to the user's local application data directory or croak
#pod with an error.
#pod
#pod =head2 BINMODE
#pod
#pod The file returned by File::Temp will have been opened in binary mode
#pod if such a mode is available. If that is not correct, use the C<binmode()>
#pod function to change the mode of the filehandle.
#pod
#pod Note that you can modify the encoding of a file opened by File::Temp
#pod also by using C<binmode()>.
#pod
#pod =head1 HISTORY
#pod
#pod Originally began life in May 1999 as an XS interface to the system
#pod mkstemp() function. In March 2000, the OpenBSD mkstemp() code was
#pod translated to Perl for total control of the code's
#pod security checking, to ensure the presence of the function regardless of
#pod operating system and to help with portability. The module was shipped
#pod as a standard part of perl from v5.6.1.
#pod
#pod Thanks to Tom Christiansen for suggesting that this module
#pod should be written and providing ideas for code improvements and
#pod security enhancements.
