delete this F<Makefile.aperl>, so the directories are searched through
for linkable libraries again.

The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally
resides on your machine with

    make inst_perl

To produce a perl binary with a different name than C<perl>, either say

    perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make myperl
    make inst_perl

or say

    perl Makefile.PL
    make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
    make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl

In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of the
C<inst_perl> target that installs the new binary into INSTALLBIN.

make inst_perl by default writes some documentation of what has been
done into the file C<$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod>. This
can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.

Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your
existing perl binary. Use with care!

Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl although
your system supports dynamic loading. In this case you may explicitly
set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or make:

    perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended

or

    make LINKTYPE=static                # works on most systems

=head2 Determination of Perl Library and Installation Locations

MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are
located.  Especially INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files
during the make(1) run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to read
existing modules from), and PERL_INC (header files and C<libperl*.*>).

Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl source
directory tree or from the installed perl library. The recommended way
is to build extensions after you have run 'make install' on perl
itself. You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not
below the perl source tree. The support for extensions below the ext
directory of the perl distribution is only good for the standard
extensions that come with perl.

If an extension is being built below the C<ext/> directory of the perl
source then MakeMaker will set PERL_SRC automatically (e.g.,
C<../..>).  If PERL_SRC is defined and the extension is recognized as
a standard extension, then other variables default to the following:

  PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
  PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
  PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
  INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
  INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB

If an extension is being built away from the perl source then MakeMaker
will leave PERL_SRC undefined and default to using the installed copy
of the perl library. The other variables default to the following:

  PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
  PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
  PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
  INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
  INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch

If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on the
command line as shown in the previous section.


=head2 Which architecture dependent directory?

If you don't want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros,
MakeMaker helps you to minimize the typing needed: the usual
relationship between INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined
by Configure at perl compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who
sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If INSTALLPRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not,
then MakeMaker defaults the latter to be the same subdirectory of
INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided for the counterparts in %Config,
otherwise it defaults to INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds
for INSTALLSITELIB and INSTALLSITEARCH.

MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure
internal variables and get different results. It is worth mentioning
that make(1) also lets you configure most of the variables that are
used in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not
be necessary, and should only be done if the author of a package
recommends it (or you know what you're doing).

=head2 Using Attributes and Parameters

The following attributes may be specified as arguments to WriteMakefile()
or as NAME=VALUE pairs on the command line. Attributes that became
available with later versions of MakeMaker are indicated.

In order to maintain portability of attributes with older versions of
MakeMaker you may want to use L<App::EUMM::Upgrade> with your C<Makefile.PL>.

=over 2

=item ABSTRACT

One line description of the module. Will be included in PPD file.

=item ABSTRACT_FROM

Name of the file that contains the package description. MakeMaker looks
for a line in the POD matching /^($package\s-\s)(.*)/. This is typically
the first line in the "=head1 NAME" section. $2 becomes the abstract.

=item AUTHOR

Array of strings containing name (and email address) of package author(s).
Is used in CPAN Meta files (META.yml or META.json) and PPD
(Perl Package Description) files for PPM (Perl Package Manager).

=item BINARY_LOCATION

Used when creating PPD files for binary packages.  It can be set to a
full or relative path or URL to the binary archive for a particular
architecture.  For example:

        perl Makefile.PL BINARY_LOCATION=x86/Agent.tar.gz

builds a PPD package that references a binary of the C<Agent> package,
located in the C<x86> directory relative to the PPD itself.

=item BUILD_REQUIRES

Available in version 6.55_03 and above.

A hash of modules that are needed to build your module but not run it.

This will go into the C<build_requires> field of your F<META.yml> and the C<build> of the C<prereqs> field of your F<META.json>.

Defaults to C<<< { "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" => 0 } >>> if this attribute is not specified.

The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.

=item C

Ref to array of *.c file names. Initialised from a directory scan
and the values portion of the XS attribute hash. This is not
currently used by MakeMaker but may be handy in Makefile.PLs.

=item CCFLAGS

String that will be included in the compiler call command line between
the arguments INC and OPTIMIZE. Note that setting this will overwrite its
default value (C<$Config::Config{ccflags}>); to preserve that, include
the default value directly, e.g.:

    CCFLAGS => "$Config::Config{ccflags} ..."

=item CONFIG

Arrayref. E.g. [qw(archname manext)] defines ARCHNAME & MANEXT from
config.sh. MakeMaker will add to CONFIG the following values anyway:
ar
cc
cccdlflags
ccdlflags
cpprun
dlext
dlsrc
ld
lddlflags
ldflags
libc
lib_ext
obj_ext
ranlib
sitelibexp
sitearchexp
so

=item CONFIGURE

CODE reference. The subroutine should return a hash reference. The
hash may contain further attributes, e.g. {LIBS =E<gt> ...}, that have to
be determined by some evaluation method.

=item CONFIGURE_REQUIRES

Available in version 6.52 and above.

A hash of modules that are required to run Makefile.PL itself, but not
to run your distribution.

This will go into the C<configure_requires> field of your F<META.yml> and the C<configure> of the C<prereqs> field of your F<META.json>.

Defaults to C<<< { "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" => 0 } >>> if this attribute is not specified.

The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.

=item DEFINE

Something like C<"-DHAVE_UNISTD_H">

=item DESTDIR

This is the root directory into which the code will be installed.  It
I<prepends itself to the normal prefix>.  For example, if your code
would normally go into F</usr/local/lib/perl> you could set DESTDIR=~/tmp/
and installation would go into F<~/tmp/usr/local/lib/perl>.

This is primarily of use for people who repackage Perl modules.

NOTE: Due to the nature of make, it is important that you put the trailing
slash on your DESTDIR.  F<~/tmp/> not F<~/tmp>.

=item DIR

Ref to array of subdirectories containing Makefile.PLs e.g. ['sdbm']
in ext/SDBM_File

=item DISTNAME

A safe filename for the package.

Defaults to NAME below but with :: replaced with -.

For example, Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar.

=item DISTVNAME

Your name for distributing the package with the version number
included.  This is used by 'make dist' to name the resulting archive
file.

Defaults to DISTNAME-VERSION.

For example, version 1.04 of Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar-1.04.

On some OS's where . has special meaning VERSION_SYM may be used in
place of VERSION.

=item DLEXT

Specifies the extension of the module's loadable object. For example:

  DLEXT => 'unusual_ext', # Default value is $Config{so}

NOTE: When using this option to alter the extension of a module's
loadable object, it is also necessary that the module's pm file
specifies the same change:

  local $DynaLoader::dl_dlext = 'unusual_ext';

=item DL_FUNCS

Hashref of symbol names for routines to be made available as universal
symbols.  Each key/value pair consists of the package name and an
array of routine names in that package.  Used only under AIX, OS/2,
VMS and Win32 at present.  The routine names supplied will be expanded
in the same way as XSUB names are expanded by the XS() macro.
Defaults to

  {"$(NAME)" => ["boot_$(NAME)" ] }

e.g.

  {"RPC" => [qw( boot_rpcb rpcb_gettime getnetconfigent )],
   "NetconfigPtr" => [ 'DESTROY'] }

Please see the L<ExtUtils::Mksymlists> documentation for more information
about the DL_FUNCS, DL_VARS and FUNCLIST attributes.

=item DL_VARS

Array of symbol names for variables to be made available as universal symbols.
Used only under AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present.  Defaults to [].
(e.g. [ qw(Foo_version Foo_numstreams Foo_tree ) ])

=item EXCLUDE_EXT

Array of extension names to exclude when doing a static build.  This
is ignored if INCLUDE_EXT is present.  Consult INCLUDE_EXT for more
details.  (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ] )

This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the
command line:  perl Makefile.PL EXCLUDE_EXT='Socket Safe'

=item EXE_FILES

Ref to array of executable files. The files will be copied to the
INST_SCRIPT directory. Make realclean will delete them from there
again.

If your executables start with something like #!perl or
#!/usr/bin/perl MakeMaker will change this to the path of the perl
'Makefile.PL' was invoked with so the programs will be sure to run
properly even if perl is not in /usr/bin/perl.

=item FIRST_MAKEFILE

The name of the Makefile to be produced.  This is used for the second
Makefile that will be produced for the MAP_TARGET.

Defaults to 'Makefile' or 'Descrip.MMS' on VMS.

(Note: we couldn't use MAKEFILE because dmake uses this for something
else).

=item FULLPERL

Perl binary able to run this extension, load XS modules, etc...

=item FULLPERLRUN

Like PERLRUN, except it uses FULLPERL.

=item FULLPERLRUNINST

Like PERLRUNINST, except it uses FULLPERL.

=item FUNCLIST

This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be
exported from the extension.  Its value is a reference to an
array of function names to be exported by the extension.  These
names are passed through unaltered to the linker options file.

=item H

Ref to array of *.h file names. Similar to C.

=item IMPORTS

This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the
extension. Takes a hash ref.

It is only used on OS/2 and Win32.

=item INC

Include file dirs eg: C<"-I/usr/5include -I/path/to/inc">

=item INCLUDE_EXT

Array of extension names to be included when doing a static build.
MakeMaker will normally build with all of the installed extensions when
doing a static build, and that is usually the desired behavior.  If
INCLUDE_EXT is present then MakeMaker will build only with those extensions
which are explicitly mentioned. (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ])

It is not necessary to mention DynaLoader or the current extension when
filling in INCLUDE_EXT.  If the INCLUDE_EXT is mentioned but is empty then
only DynaLoader and the current extension will be included in the build.

This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the
command line:  perl Makefile.PL INCLUDE_EXT='POSIX Socket Devel::Peek'

=item INSTALLARCHLIB

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to perl.

=item INSTALLBIN

Directory to install binary files (e.g. tkperl) into if
INSTALLDIRS=perl.

=item INSTALLDIRS

Determines which of the sets of installation directories to choose:
perl, site or vendor.  Defaults to site.

=item INSTALLMAN1DIR

=item INSTALLMAN3DIR

These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if
INSTALLDIRS=perl.  Defaults to $Config{installman*dir}.

If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.

=item INSTALLPRIVLIB

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to perl.

Defaults to $Config{installprivlib}.

=item INSTALLSCRIPT

Available in version 6.30_02 and above.

Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS=perl.

=item INSTALLSITEARCH

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).

=item INSTALLSITEBIN

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_BIN to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).

=item INSTALLSITELIB

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).

=item INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR

=item INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR

These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if
INSTALLDIRS=site (default).  Defaults to
$(SITEPREFIX)/man/man$(MAN*EXT).

If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.

=item INSTALLSITESCRIPT

Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).

=item INSTALLVENDORARCH

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor. Note that if you do not set
this, the value of INSTALLVENDORLIB will be used, which is probably not
what you want.

=item INSTALLVENDORBIN

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_BIN to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.

=item INSTALLVENDORLIB

Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.

=item INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR

=item INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR

These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if
INSTALLDIRS=vendor.  Defaults to $(VENDORPREFIX)/man/man$(MAN*EXT).

If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.

=item INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT

Available in version 6.30_02 and above.

Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this
directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.

=item INST_ARCHLIB

Same as INST_LIB for architecture dependent files.

=item INST_BIN

Directory to put real binary files during 'make'. These will be copied
to INSTALLBIN during 'make install'

=item INST_LIB

Directory where we put library files of this extension while building
it.

=item INST_MAN1DIR

Directory to hold the man pages at 'make' time

=item INST_MAN3DIR

Directory to hold the man pages at 'make' time

=item INST_SCRIPT

Directory where executable files should be installed during
'make'. Defaults to "./blib/script", just to have a dummy location during
testing. make install will copy the files in INST_SCRIPT to
INSTALLSCRIPT.

=item LD

Program to be used to link libraries for dynamic loading.

Defaults to $Config{ld}.

=item LDDLFLAGS

Any special flags that might need to be passed to ld to create a
shared library suitable for dynamic loading.  It is up to the makefile
to use it.  (See L<Config/lddlflags>)

Defaults to $Config{lddlflags}.

=item LDFROM

Defaults to "$(OBJECT)" and is used in the ld command to specify
what files to link/load from (also see dynamic_lib below for how to
specify ld flags)

=item LIB

LIB should only be set at C<perl Makefile.PL> time but is allowed as a
MakeMaker argument. It has the effect of setting both INSTALLPRIVLIB
and INSTALLSITELIB to that value regardless any explicit setting of
those arguments (or of PREFIX).  INSTALLARCHLIB and INSTALLSITEARCH
are set to the corresponding architecture subdirectory.

=item LIBPERL_A

The filename of the perllibrary that will be used together with this
extension. Defaults to libperl.a.

=item LIBS

An anonymous array of alternative library
specifications to be searched for (in order) until
at least one library is found. E.g.

  'LIBS' => ["-lgdbm", "-ldbm -lfoo", "-L/path -ldbm.nfs"]

Mind, that any element of the array
contains a complete set of arguments for the ld
command. So do not specify

  'LIBS' => ["-ltcl", "-ltk", "-lX11"]

See ODBM_File/Makefile.PL for an example, where an array is needed. If
you specify a scalar as in

  'LIBS' => "-ltcl -ltk -lX11"

MakeMaker will turn it into an array with one element.

=item LICENSE

Available in version 6.31 and above.

The licensing terms of your distribution.  Generally it's "perl_5" for the
same license as Perl itself.

See L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> for the list of options.

Defaults to "unknown".

=item LINKTYPE

'static' or 'dynamic' (default unless usedl=undef in
config.sh). Should only be used to force static linking (also see
linkext below).

=item MAGICXS

Available in version 6.8305 and above.

When this is set to C<1>, C<OBJECT> will be automagically derived from
C<O_FILES>.

=item MAKE

Available in version 6.30_01 and above.

Variant of make you intend to run the generated Makefile with.  This
parameter lets Makefile.PL know what make quirks to account for when
generating the Makefile.

MakeMaker also honors the MAKE environment variable.  This parameter
takes precedence.

Currently the only significant values are 'dmake' and 'nmake' for Windows
users, instructing MakeMaker to generate a Makefile in the flavour of
DMake ("Dennis Vadura's Make") or Microsoft NMake respectively.

Defaults to $Config{make}, which may go looking for a Make program
in your environment.

How are you supposed to know what flavour of Make a Makefile has
been generated for if you didn't specify a value explicitly? Search
the generated Makefile for the definition of the MAKE variable,
which is used to recursively invoke the Make utility. That will tell
you what Make you're supposed to invoke the Makefile with.

=item MAKEAPERL

Boolean which tells MakeMaker that it should include the rules to
make a perl. This is handled automatically as a switch by
MakeMaker. The user normally does not need it.

=item MAKEFILE_OLD

When 'make clean' or similar is run, the $(FIRST_MAKEFILE) will be
backed up at this location.

Defaults to $(FIRST_MAKEFILE).old or $(FIRST_MAKEFILE)_old on VMS.

=item MAN1PODS

Hashref of pod-containing files. MakeMaker will default this to all
EXE_FILES files that include POD directives. The files listed
here will be converted to man pages and installed as was requested
at Configure time.

This hash should map POD files (or scripts containing POD) to the
man file names under the C<blib/man1/> directory, as in the following
example:

  MAN1PODS            => {
    'doc/command.pod'    => 'blib/man1/command.1',
    'scripts/script.pl'  => 'blib/man1/script.1',
  }

=item MAN3PODS

Hashref that assigns to *.pm and *.pod files the files into which the
manpages are to be written. MakeMaker parses all *.pod and *.pm files
for POD directives. Files that contain POD will be the default keys of
the MAN3PODS hashref. These will then be converted to man pages during
C<make> and will be installed during C<make install>.

Example similar to MAN1PODS.

=item MAP_TARGET

If it is intended that a new perl binary be produced, this variable
may hold a name for that binary. Defaults to perl

=item META_ADD

=item META_MERGE

Available in version 6.46 and above.

A hashref of items to add to the CPAN Meta file (F<META.yml> or
F<META.json>).

They differ in how they behave if they have the same key as the
default metadata.  META_ADD will override the default value with its
own.  META_MERGE will merge its value with the default.

Unless you want to override the defaults, prefer META_MERGE so as to
get the advantage of any future defaults.

Where prereqs are concerned, if META_MERGE is used, prerequisites are merged
with their counterpart C<WriteMakefile()> argument
(PREREQ_PM is merged into {prereqs}{runtime}{requires},
BUILD_REQUIRES into C<{prereqs}{build}{requires}>,
CONFIGURE_REQUIRES into C<{prereqs}{configure}{requires}>,
and TEST_REQUIRES into C<{prereqs}{test}{requires})>.
When prereqs are specified with META_ADD, the only prerequisites added to the
file come from the metadata, not C<WriteMakefile()> arguments.

Note that these configuration options are only used for generating F<META.yml>
and F<META.json> -- they are NOT used for F<MYMETA.yml> and F<MYMETA.json>.
Therefore data in these fields should NOT be used for dynamic (user-side)
configuration.

By default CPAN Meta specification C<1.4> is used. In order to use
CPAN Meta specification C<2.0>, indicate with C<meta-spec> the version
you want to use.

  META_MERGE        => {

    "meta-spec" => { version => 2 },

    resources => {

      repository => {
          type => 'git',
          url => 'git://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/ExtUtils-MakeMaker.git',
          web => 'https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/ExtUtils-MakeMaker',
      },

    },

  },

=item MIN_PERL_VERSION

Available in version 6.48 and above.

The minimum required version of Perl for this distribution.

Either the 5.006001 or the 5.6.1 format is acceptable.

=item MYEXTLIB

If the extension links to a library that it builds, set this to the
name of the library (see SDBM_File)

=item NAME

The package representing the distribution. For example, C<Test::More>
or C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>. It will be used to derive information about
the distribution such as the L</DISTNAME>, installation locations
within the Perl library and where XS files will be looked for by
default (see L</XS>).

C<NAME> I<must> be a valid Perl package name and it I<must> have an
associated C<.pm> file. For example, C<Foo::Bar> is a valid C<NAME>
and there must exist F<Foo/Bar.pm>.  Any XS code should be in
F<Bar.xs> unless stated otherwise.

Your distribution B<must> have a C<NAME>.

=item NEEDS_LINKING

MakeMaker will figure out if an extension contains linkable code
anywhere down the directory tree, and will set this variable
accordingly, but you can speed it up a very little bit if you define
this boolean variable yourself.

=item NOECHO

Command so make does not print the literal commands it's running.

By setting it to an empty string you can generate a Makefile that
prints all commands. Mainly used in debugging MakeMaker itself.

Defaults to C<@>.

=item NORECURS

Boolean.  Attribute to inhibit descending into subdirectories.

=item NO_META

When true, suppresses the generation and addition to the MANIFEST of
the META.yml and META.json module meta-data files during 'make distdir'.

Defaults to false.

=item NO_MYMETA

Available in version 6.57_02 and above.

When true, suppresses the generation of MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json module
meta-data files during 'perl Makefile.PL'.

Defaults to false.

=item NO_PACKLIST

Available in version 6.7501 and above.

When true, suppresses the writing of C<packlist> files for installs.

Defaults to false.

=item NO_PERLLOCAL

Available in version 6.7501 and above.

When true, suppresses the appending of installations to C<perllocal>.

Defaults to false.

=item NO_VC

In general, any generated Makefile checks for the current version of
MakeMaker and the version the Makefile was built under. If NO_VC is
set, the version check is neglected. Do not write this into your
Makefile.PL, use it interactively instead.

=item OBJECT

List of object files, defaults to '$(BASEEXT)$(OBJ_EXT)', but can be a long
string or an array containing all object files, e.g. "tkpBind.o
tkpButton.o tkpCanvas.o" or ["tkpBind.o", "tkpButton.o", "tkpCanvas.o"]

(Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME, and OBJ_EXT is $Config{obj_ext}.)

=item OPTIMIZE

Defaults to C<-O>. Set it to C<-g> to turn debugging on. The flag is
passed to subdirectory makes.

=item PERL

Perl binary for tasks that can be done by miniperl. If it contains
spaces or other shell metacharacters, it needs to be quoted in a way
that protects them, since this value is intended to be inserted in a
shell command line in the Makefile. E.g.:

  # Perl executable lives in "C:/Program Files/Perl/bin"
  # Normally you don't need to set this yourself!
  $ perl Makefile.PL PERL='"C:/Program Files/Perl/bin/perl.exe" -w'

=item PERL_CORE

Set only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core
distribution.

=item PERLMAINCC

The call to the program that is able to compile perlmain.c. Defaults
to $(CC).

=item PERL_ARCHLIB

Same as for PERL_LIB, but for architecture dependent files.

Used only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core
distribution (because normally $(PERL_ARCHLIB) is automatically in @INC,
and adding it would get in the way of PERL5LIB).

=item PERL_LIB

Directory containing the Perl library to use.

Used only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core
distribution (because normally $(PERL_LIB) is automatically in @INC,
and adding it would get in the way of PERL5LIB).

=item PERL_MALLOC_OK

defaults to 0.  Should be set to TRUE if the extension can work with
the memory allocation routines substituted by the Perl malloc() subsystem.
This should be applicable to most extensions with exceptions of those

=over 4

=item *

with bugs in memory allocations which are caught by Perl's malloc();

=item *

which interact with the memory allocator in other ways than via
malloc(), realloc(), free(), calloc(), sbrk() and brk();

=item *

which rely on special alignment which is not provided by Perl's malloc().

=back

B<NOTE.>  Neglecting to set this flag in I<any one> of the loaded extension
nullifies many advantages of Perl's malloc(), such as better usage of
system resources, error detection, memory usage reporting, catchable failure
of memory allocations, etc.

=item PERLPREFIX

Directory under which core modules are to be installed.

Defaults to $Config{installprefixexp}, falling back to
$Config{installprefix}, $Config{prefixexp} or $Config{prefix} should
$Config{installprefixexp} not exist.

Overridden by PREFIX.

=item PERLRUN

Use this instead of $(PERL) when you wish to run perl.  It will set up
extra necessary flags for you.

=item PERLRUNINST

Use this instead of $(PERL) when you wish to run perl to work with
modules.  It will add things like -I$(INST_ARCH) and other necessary
flags so perl can see the modules you're about to install.

=item PERL_SRC

Directory containing the Perl source code (use of this should be
avoided, it may be undefined)

=item PERM_DIR

Available in version 6.51_01 and above.

Desired permission for directories. Defaults to C<755>.

=item PERM_RW

Desired permission for read/writable files. Defaults to C<644>.

=item PERM_RWX

Desired permission for executable files. Defaults to C<755>.

=item PL_FILES

MakeMaker can run programs to generate files for you at build time.
By default any file named *.PL (except Makefile.PL and Build.PL) in
the top level directory will be assumed to be a Perl program and run
passing its own basename in as an argument.  This basename is actually a build
target, and there is an intention, but not a requirement, that the *.PL file
make the file passed to to as an argument. For example...

    perl foo.PL foo

This behavior can be overridden by supplying your own set of files to
search.  PL_FILES accepts a hash ref, the key being the file to run
and the value is passed in as the first argument when the PL file is run.

    PL_FILES => {'bin/foobar.PL' => 'bin/foobar'}

    PL_FILES => {'foo.PL' => 'foo.c'}

Would run bin/foobar.PL like this:

    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar

If multiple files from one program are desired an array ref can be used.

    PL_FILES => {'bin/foobar.PL' => [qw(bin/foobar1 bin/foobar2)]}

In this case the program will be run multiple times using each target file.

    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar1
    perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar2

If an output file depends on extra input files beside the script itself,
a hash ref can be used in version 7.36 and above:

    PL_FILES => { 'foo.PL' => {
        'foo.out' => 'foo.in',
        'bar.out' => [qw(bar1.in bar2.in)],
    }

In this case the extra input files will be passed to the program after
the target file:

   perl foo.PL foo.out foo.in
   perl foo.PL bar.out bar1.in bar2.in

PL files are normally run B<after> pm_to_blib and include INST_LIB and
INST_ARCH in their C<@INC>, so the just built modules can be
accessed... unless the PL file is making a module (or anything else in
PM) in which case it is run B<before> pm_to_blib and does not include
INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its C<@INC>.  This apparently odd behavior
is there for backwards compatibility (and it's somewhat DWIM).  The argument
passed to the .PL is set up as a target to build in the Makefile.  In other
sections such as C<postamble> you can specify a dependency on the
filename/argument that the .PL is supposed (or will have, now that that is
is a dependency) to generate.  Note the file to be generated will still be
generated and the .PL will still run even without an explicit dependency created
by you, since the C<all> target still depends on running all eligible to run.PL
files.

=item PM

Hashref of .pm files and *.pl files to be installed.  e.g.

  {'name_of_file.pm' => '$(INST_LIB)/install_as.pm'}

By default this will include *.pm and *.pl and the files found in
the PMLIBDIRS directories.  Defining PM in the
Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.

=item PMLIBDIRS

Ref to array of subdirectories containing library files.  Defaults to
[ 'lib', $(BASEEXT) ]. The directories will be scanned and I<any> files
they contain will be installed in the corresponding location in the
library.  A libscan() method can be used to alter the behaviour.
Defining PM in the Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.

(Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME.)

=item PM_FILTER

A filter program, in the traditional Unix sense (input from stdin, output
to stdout) that is passed on each .pm file during the build (in the
pm_to_blib() phase).  It is empty by default, meaning no filtering is done.
You could use:

  PM_FILTER => 'perl -ne "print unless /^\\#/"',

to remove all the leading comments on the fly during the build.  In order
to be as portable as possible, please consider using a Perl one-liner
rather than Unix (or other) utilities, as above.  The # is escaped for
the Makefile, since what is going to be generated will then be:

  PM_FILTER = perl -ne "print unless /^\#/"

Without the \ before the #, we'd have the start of a Makefile comment,
and the macro would be incorrectly defined.

You will almost certainly be better off using the C<PL_FILES> system,
instead. See above, or the L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ> entry.

=item POLLUTE

Prior to 5.6 various interpreter variables were available without a C<PL_>
prefix, eg. C<PL_undef> was available as C<undef>. As of release 5.6, these
