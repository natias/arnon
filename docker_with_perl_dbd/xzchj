that have been defined.

Note: the behaviour described in this section can be disabled
by setting C<fallback> to FALSE (see L</fallback>).

In the following tables, numbers indicate priority.
For example, the table below states that,
if no implementation for C<'!'> has been defined then Perl will
implement it using C<'bool'> (that is, by inverting the value
returned by the method for C<'bool'>);
if boolean conversion is also unimplemented then Perl will
use C<'0+'> or, failing that, C<'""'>.

    operator | can be autogenerated from
             |
             | 0+   ""   bool   .   x
    =========|==========================
       0+    |       1     2
       ""    |  1          2
       bool  |  1    2
       int   |  1    2     3
       !     |  2    3     1
       qr    |  2    1     3
       .     |  2    1     3
       x     |  2    1     3
       .=    |  3    2     4    1

       <>    |  2    1     3
       -X    |  2    1     3

Note: The iterator (C<'E<lt>E<gt>'>) and file test (C<'-X'>)
operators work as normal: if the operand is not a blessed glob or
IO reference then it is converted to a string (using the method
for C<'""'>, C<'0+'>, or C<'bool'>) to be interpreted as a glob
or filename.

    operator | can be autogenerated from
             |
             |  <   <=>   neg   -=    -
    =========|==========================
       neg   |                        1
       -=    |                        1
       --    |                   1    2
       abs   | a1    a2    b1        b2    [*]
       <     |        1
       <=    |        1
       >     |        1
       >=    |        1
       ==    |        1
       !=    |        1

    * one from [a1, a2] and one from [b1, b2]

Just as numeric comparisons can be autogenerated from the method
for C<< '<=>' >>, string comparisons can be autogenerated from
that for C<'cmp'>:

     operators          |  can be autogenerated from
    ====================|===========================
     lt gt le ge eq ne  |  cmp

Similarly, autogeneration for keys C<'+='> and C<'++'> is analogous
to C<'-='> and C<'--'> above:

    operator | can be autogenerated from
             |
             |  +=    +
    =========|==========================
        +=   |        1
        ++   |   1    2

And other assignment variations are analogous to
C<'+='> and C<'-='> (and similar to C<'.='> and C<'x='> above):

              operator ||  *= /= %= **= <<= >>= &= ^= |= &.= ^.= |.=
    -------------------||-------------------------------------------
    autogenerated from ||  *  /  %  **  <<  >>  &  ^  |  &.  ^.  |.

Note also that the copy constructor (key C<'='>) may be
autogenerated, but only for objects based on scalars.
See L</Copy Constructor>.

=head3 Minimal Set of Overloaded Operations

Since some operations can be automatically generated from others, there is
a minimal set of operations that need to be overloaded in order to have
the complete set of overloaded operations at one's disposal.
Of course, the autogenerated operations may not do exactly what the user
expects.  The minimal set is:

    + - * / % ** << >> x
    <=> cmp
    & | ^ ~ &. |. ^. ~.
    atan2 cos sin exp log sqrt int
    "" 0+ bool
    ~~

Of the conversions, only one of string, boolean or numeric is
needed because each can be generated from either of the other two.

=head2 Special Keys for C<use overload>

=head3 C<nomethod>

The C<'nomethod'> key is used to specify a catch-all function to
be called for any operator that is not individually overloaded.
The specified function will be passed four parameters.
The first three arguments coincide with those that would have been
passed to the corresponding method if it had been defined.
The fourth argument is the C<use overload> key for that missing
method.  If the "bitwise" feature is enabled (see L<feature>),
a fifth TRUE argument is passed to subroutines handling C<&>, C<|>, C<^> and C<~> to indicate that the caller is expecting numeric behaviour.

For example, if C<$a> is an object blessed into a package declaring

    use overload 'nomethod' => 'catch_all', # ...

then the operation

    3 + $a

could (unless a method is specifically declared for the key
C<'+'>) result in a call

    catch_all($a, 3, 1, '+')

See L</How Perl Chooses an Operator Implementation>.

=head3 C<fallback>

The value assigned to the key C<'fallback'> tells Perl how hard
it should try to find an alternative way to implement a missing
operator.

=over

=item * defined, but FALSE

    use overload "fallback" => 0, # ... ;

This disables L</Magic Autogeneration>.

=item * C<undef>

In the default case where no value is explicitly assigned to
C<fallback>, magic autogeneration is enabled.

=item * TRUE

The same as for C<undef>, but if a missing operator cannot be
autogenerated then, instead of issuing an error message, Perl
is allowed to revert to what it would have done for that
operator if there had been no C<use overload> directive.

Note: in most cases, particularly the L</Copy Constructor>,
this is unlikely to be appropriate behaviour.

=back

See L</How Perl Chooses an Operator Implementation>.

=head3 Copy Constructor

As mentioned L<above|"Mathemagic, Mutators, and Copy Constructors">,
this operation is called when a mutator is applied to a reference
that shares its object with some other reference.
For example, if C<$b> is mathemagical, and C<'++'> is overloaded
with C<'incr'>, and C<'='> is overloaded with C<'clone'>, then the
code

    $a = $b;
    # ... (other code which does not modify $a or $b) ...
    ++$b;

would be executed in a manner equivalent to

    $a = $b;
    # ...
    $b = $b->clone(undef, "");
    $b->incr(undef, "");

Note:

=over

=item *

The subroutine for C<'='> does not overload the Perl assignment
operator: it is used only to allow mutators to work as described
here.  (See L</Assignments> above.)

=item *

As for other operations, the subroutine implementing '=' is passed
three arguments, though the last two are always C<undef> and C<''>.

=item *

The copy constructor is called only before a call to a function
declared to implement a mutator, for example, if C<++$b;> in the
code above is effected via a method declared for key C<'++'>
(or 'nomethod', passed C<'++'> as the fourth argument) or, by
autogeneration, C<'+='>.
It is not called if the increment operation is effected by a call
to the method for C<'+'> since, in the equivalent code,

    $a = $b;
    $b = $b + 1;

the data referred to by C<$a> is unchanged by the assignment to
C<$b> of a reference to new object data.

=item *

The copy constructor is not called if Perl determines that it is
unnecessary because there is no other reference to the data being
modified.

=item *

If C<'fallback'> is undefined or TRUE then a copy constructor
can be autogenerated, but only for objects based on scalars.
In other cases it needs to be defined explicitly.
Where an object's data is stored as, for example, an array of
scalars, the following might be appropriate:

    use overload '=' => sub { bless [ @{$_[0]} ] },  # ...

=item *

If C<'fallback'> is TRUE and no copy constructor is defined then,
for objects not based on scalars, Perl may silently fall back on
simple assignment - that is, assignment of the object reference.
In effect, this disables the copy constructor mechanism since
no new copy of the object data is created.
This is almost certainly not what you want.
(It is, however, consistent: for example, Perl's fallback for the
C<++> operator is to increment the reference itself.)

=back

=head2 How Perl Chooses an Operator Implementation

Which is checked first, C<nomethod> or C<fallback>?
If the two operands of an operator are of different types and
both overload the operator, which implementation is used?
The following are the precedence rules:

=over

=item 1.

If the first operand has declared a subroutine to overload the
operator then use that implementation.

=item 2.

Otherwise, if fallback is TRUE or undefined for the
first operand then see if the
L<rules for autogeneration|"Magic Autogeneration">
allows another of its operators to be used instead.

=item 3.

Unless the operator is an assignment (C<+=>, C<-=>, etc.),
repeat step (1) in respect of the second operand.

=item 4.

Repeat Step (2) in respect of the second operand.

=item 5.

If the first operand has a "nomethod" method then use that.

=item 6.

If the second operand has a "nomethod" method then use that.

=item 7.

If C<fallback> is TRUE for both operands
then perform the usual operation for the operator,
treating the operands as numbers, strings, or booleans
as appropriate for the operator (see note).

=item 8.

Nothing worked - die.

=back

Where there is only one operand (or only one operand with
overloading) the checks in respect of the other operand above are
skipped.

There are exceptions to the above rules for dereference operations
(which, if Step 1 fails, always fall back to the normal, built-in
implementations - see Dereferencing), and for C<~~> (which has its
own set of rules - see C<Matching> under L</Overloadable Operations>
above).

Note on Step 7: some operators have a different semantic depending
on the type of their operands.
As there is no way to instruct Perl to treat the operands as, e.g.,
numbers instead of strings, the result here may not be what you
expect.
See L</BUGS AND PITFALLS>.

=head2 Losing Overloading

The restriction for the comparison operation is that even if, for example,
C<cmp> should return a blessed reference, the autogenerated C<lt>
function will produce only a standard logical value based on the
numerical value of the result of C<cmp>.  In particular, a working
numeric conversion is needed in this case (possibly expressed in terms of
other conversions).

Similarly, C<.=>  and C<x=> operators lose their mathemagical properties
if the string conversion substitution is applied.

When you chop() a mathemagical object it is promoted to a string and its
mathemagical properties are lost.  The same can happen with other
operations as well.

=head2 Inheritance and Overloading

Overloading respects inheritance via the @ISA hierarchy.
Inheritance interacts with overloading in two ways.

=over

=item Method names in the C<use overload> directive

If C<value> in

  use overload key => value;

is a string, it is interpreted as a method name - which may
(in the usual way) be inherited from another class.

=item Overloading of an operation is inherited by derived classes

Any class derived from an overloaded class is also overloaded
and inherits its operator implementations.
If the same operator is overloaded in more than one ancestor
then the implementation is determined by the usual inheritance
rules.

For example, if C<A> inherits from C<B> and C<C> (in that order),
C<B> overloads C<+> with C<\&D::plus_sub>, and C<C> overloads
C<+> by C<"plus_meth">, then the subroutine C<D::plus_sub> will
be called to implement operation C<+> for an object in package C<A>.

=back

Note that in Perl version prior to 5.18 inheritance of the C<fallback> key
was not governed by the above rules.  The value of C<fallback> in the first 
overloaded ancestor was used.  This was fixed in 5.18 to follow the usual
rules of inheritance.

=head2 Run-time Overloading

Since all C<use> directives are executed at compile-time, the only way to
change overloading during run-time is to

    eval 'use overload "+" => \&addmethod';

You can also use

    eval 'no overload "+", "--", "<="';

though the use of these constructs during run-time is questionable.

=head2 Public Functions

Package C<overload.pm> provides the following public functions:

=over 5

=item overload::StrVal(arg)

Gives the string value of C<arg> as in the
absence of stringify overloading.  If you
are using this to get the address of a reference (useful for checking if two
references point to the same thing) then you may be better off using
C<builtin::refaddr()> or C<Scalar::Util::refaddr()>, which are faster.

=item overload::Overloaded(arg)

Returns true if C<arg> is subject to overloading of some operations.

=item overload::Method(obj,op)

Returns C<undef> or a reference to the method that implements C<op>.

Such a method always takes three arguments, which will be enforced if
it is an XS method.

=back

=head2 Overloading Constants

For some applications, the Perl parser mangles constants too much.
It is possible to hook into this process via C<overload::constant()>
and C<overload::remove_constant()> functions.

These functions take a hash as an argument.  The recognized keys of this hash
are:

=over 8

=item integer

to overload integer constants,

=item float

to overload floating point constants,

=item binary

to overload octal and hexadecimal constants,

=item q

to overload C<q>-quoted strings, constant pieces of C<qq>- and C<qx>-quoted
strings and here-documents,

=item qr

to overload constant pieces of regular expressions.

=back

The corresponding values are references to functions which take three arguments:
the first one is the I<initial> string form of the constant, the second one
is how Perl interprets this constant, the third one is how the constant is used.
Note that the initial string form does not
contain string delimiters, and has backslashes in backslash-delimiter
combinations stripped (thus the value of delimiter is not relevant for
processing of this string).  The return value of this function is how this
constant is going to be interpreted by Perl.  The third argument is undefined
unless for overloaded C<q>- and C<qr>- constants, it is C<q> in single-quote
context (comes from strings, regular expressions, and single-quote HERE
documents), it is C<tr> for arguments of C<tr>/C<y> operators,
it is C<s> for right-hand side of C<s>-operator, and it is C<qq> otherwise.

Since an expression C<"ab$cd,,"> is just a shortcut for C<'ab' . $cd . ',,'>,
it is expected that overloaded constant strings are equipped with reasonable
overloaded catenation operator, otherwise absurd results will result.
Similarly, negative numbers are considered as negations of positive constants.

Note that it is probably meaningless to call the functions overload::constant()
and overload::remove_constant() from anywhere but import() and unimport() methods.
From these methods they may be called as

    sub import {
       shift;
       return unless @_;
       die "unknown import: @_" unless @_ == 1 and $_[0] eq ':constant';
       overload::constant integer => sub {Math::BigInt->new(shift)};
    }

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

What follows is subject to change RSN.

The table of methods for all operations is cached in magic for the
symbol table hash for the package.  The cache is invalidated during
processing of C<use overload>, C<no overload>, new function
definitions, and changes in @ISA.

(Every SVish thing has a magic queue, and magic is an entry in that
queue.  This is how a single variable may participate in multiple
forms of magic simultaneously.  For instance, environment variables
regularly have two forms at once: their %ENV magic and their taint
magic.  However, the magic which implements overloading is applied to
the stashes, which are rarely used directly, thus should not slow down
Perl.)

If a package uses overload, it carries a special flag.  This flag is also
set when new functions are defined or @ISA is modified.  There will be a
slight speed penalty on the very first operation thereafter that supports
overloading, while the overload tables are updated.  If there is no
overloading present, the flag is turned off.  Thus the only speed penalty
thereafter is the checking of this flag.

It is expected that arguments to methods that are not explicitly supposed
to be changed are constant (but this is not enforced).

=head1 COOKBOOK

Please add examples to what follows!

=head2 Two-face Scalars

Put this in F<two_face.pm> in your Perl library directory:

  package two_face;		# Scalars with separate string and
                                # numeric values.
  sub new { my $p = shift; bless [@_], $p }
  use overload '""' => \&str, '0+' => \&num, fallback => 1;
  sub num {shift->[1]}
  sub str {shift->[0]}

Use it as follows:

  require two_face;
  my $seven = two_face->new("vii", 7);
  printf "seven=$seven, seven=%d, eight=%d\n", $seven, $seven+1;
  print "seven contains 'i'\n" if $seven =~ /i/;

(The second line creates a scalar which has both a string value, and a
numeric value.)  This prints:

  seven=vii, seven=7, eight=8
  seven contains 'i'

=head2 Two-face References

Suppose you want to create an object which is accessible as both an
array reference and a hash reference.

  package two_refs;
  use overload '%{}' => \&gethash, '@{}' => sub { $ {shift()} };
  sub new {
    my $p = shift;
    bless \ [@_], $p;
  }
  sub gethash {
    my %h;
    my $self = shift;
    tie %h, ref $self, $self;
    \%h;
  }

  sub TIEHASH { my $p = shift; bless \ shift, $p }
  my %fields;
  my $i = 0;
  $fields{$_} = $i++ foreach qw{zero one two three};
  sub STORE {
    my $self = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die "Out of band access";
    $$self->[$key] = shift;
  }
  sub FETCH {
    my $self = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die "Out of band access";
    $$self->[$key];
  }

Now one can access an object using both the array and hash syntax:

  my $bar = two_refs->new(3,4,5,6);
  $bar->[2] = 11;
  $bar->{two} == 11 or die 'bad hash fetch';

Note several important features of this example.  First of all, the
I<actual> type of $bar is a scalar reference, and we do not overload
the scalar dereference.  Thus we can get the I<actual> non-overloaded
contents of $bar by just using C<$$bar> (what we do in functions which
overload dereference).  Similarly, the object returned by the
TIEHASH() method is a scalar reference.

Second, we create a new tied hash each time the hash syntax is used.
This allows us not to worry about a possibility of a reference loop,
which would lead to a memory leak.

Both these problems can be cured.  Say, if we want to overload hash
dereference on a reference to an object which is I<implemented> as a
hash itself, the only problem one has to circumvent is how to access
this I<actual> hash (as opposed to the I<virtual> hash exhibited by the
overloaded dereference operator).  Here is one possible fetching routine:

  sub access_hash {
    my ($self, $key) = (shift, shift);
    my $class = ref $self;
    bless $self, 'overload::dummy'; # Disable overloading of %{}
    my $out = $self->{$key};
    bless $self, $class;	# Restore overloading
    $out;
  }

To remove creation of the tied hash on each access, one may an extra
level of indirection which allows a non-circular structure of references:

  package two_refs1;
  use overload '%{}' => sub { ${shift()}->[1] },
               '@{}' => sub { ${shift()}->[0] };
  sub new {
    my $p = shift;
    my $a = [@_];
    my %h;
    tie %h, $p, $a;
    bless \ [$a, \%h], $p;
  }
  sub gethash {
    my %h;
    my $self = shift;
    tie %h, ref $self, $self;
    \%h;
  }

  sub TIEHASH { my $p = shift; bless \ shift, $p }
  my %fields;
  my $i = 0;
  $fields{$_} = $i++ foreach qw{zero one two three};
  sub STORE {
    my $a = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die "Out of band access";
    $a->[$key] = shift;
  }
  sub FETCH {
    my $a = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die "Out of band access";
    $a->[$key];
  }

Now if $baz is overloaded like this, then C<$baz> is a reference to a
reference to the intermediate array, which keeps a reference to an
actual array, and the access hash.  The tie()ing object for the access
hash is a reference to a reference to the actual array, so

=over

=item *

There are no loops of references.

=item *

Both "objects" which are blessed into the class C<two_refs1> are
references to a reference to an array, thus references to a I<scalar>.
Thus the accessor expression C<$$foo-E<gt>[$ind]> involves no
overloaded operations.

=back

=head2 Symbolic Calculator

Put this in F<symbolic.pm> in your Perl library directory:

  package symbolic;		# Primitive symbolic calculator
  use overload nomethod => \&wrap;

  sub new { shift; bless ['n', @_] }
  sub wrap {
    my ($obj, $other, $inv, $meth) = @_;
    ($obj, $other) = ($other, $obj) if $inv;
    bless [$meth, $obj, $other];
  }

This module is very unusual as overloaded modules go: it does not
provide any usual overloaded operators, instead it provides an
implementation for C<L</nomethod>>.  In this example the C<nomethod>
subroutine returns an object which encapsulates operations done over
the objects: C<< symbolic->new(3) >> contains C<['n', 3]>, C<< 2 +
symbolic->new(3) >> contains C<['+', 2, ['n', 3]]>.

Here is an example of the script which "calculates" the side of
circumscribed octagon using the above package:

  require symbolic;
  my $iter = 1;			# 2**($iter+2) = 8
  my $side = symbolic->new(1);
  my $cnt = $iter;

  while ($cnt--) {
    $side = (sqrt(1 + $side**2) - 1)/$side;
  }
  print "OK\n";

The value of $side is

  ['/', ['-', ['sqrt', ['+', 1, ['**', ['n', 1], 2]],
	               undef], 1], ['n', 1]]

Note that while we obtained this value using a nice little script,
there is no simple way to I<use> this value.  In fact this value may
be inspected in debugger (see L<perldebug>), but only if
C<bareStringify> B<O>ption is set, and not via C<p> command.

If one attempts to print this value, then the overloaded operator
C<""> will be called, which will call C<nomethod> operator.  The
result of this operator will be stringified again, but this result is
again of type C<symbolic>, which will lead to an infinite loop.

Add a pretty-printer method to the module F<symbolic.pm>:

  sub pretty {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    $a = 'u' unless defined $a;
    $b = 'u' unless defined $b;
    $a = $a->pretty if ref $a;
    $b = $b->pretty if ref $b;
    "[$meth $a $b]";
  }

Now one can finish the script by

  print "side = ", $side->pretty, "\n";

The method C<pretty> is doing object-to-string conversion, so it
is natural to overload the operator C<""> using this method.  However,
inside such a method it is not necessary to pretty-print the
I<components> $a and $b of an object.  In the above subroutine
C<"[$meth $a $b]"> is a catenation of some strings and components $a
and $b.  If these components use overloading, the catenation operator
will look for an overloaded operator C<.>; if not present, it will
look for an overloaded operator C<"">.  Thus it is enough to use

  use overload nomethod => \&wrap, '""' => \&str;
  sub str {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    $a = 'u' unless defined $a;
    $b = 'u' unless defined $b;
    "[$meth $a $b]";
  }

Now one can change the last line of the script to

  print "side = $side\n";

which outputs

  side = [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1 u] 2]] u] 1] [n 1 u]]

and one can inspect the value in debugger using all the possible
methods.

Something is still amiss: consider the loop variable $cnt of the
script.  It was a number, not an object.  We cannot make this value of
type C<symbolic>, since then the loop will not terminate.

Indeed, to terminate the cycle, the $cnt should become false.
However, the operator C<bool> for checking falsity is overloaded (this
time via overloaded C<"">), and returns a long string, thus any object
of type C<symbolic> is true.  To overcome this, we need a way to
compare an object to 0.  In fact, it is easier to write a numeric
conversion routine.

Here is the text of F<symbolic.pm> with such a routine added (and
slightly modified str()):

  package symbolic;		# Primitive symbolic calculator
  use overload
    nomethod => \&wrap, '""' => \&str, '0+' => \&num;

  sub new { shift; bless ['n', @_] }
  sub wrap {
    my ($obj, $other, $inv, $meth) = @_;
    ($obj, $other) = ($other, $obj) if $inv;
    bless [$meth, $obj, $other];
  }
  sub str {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    $a = 'u' unless defined $a;
    if (defined $b) {
      "[$meth $a $b]";
    } else {
      "[$meth $a]";
    }
  }
  my %subr = ( n => sub {$_[0]},
	       sqrt => sub {sqrt $_[0]},
	       '-' => sub {shift() - shift()},
	       '+' => sub {shift() + shift()},
	       '/' => sub {shift() / shift()},
	       '*' => sub {shift() * shift()},
	       '**' => sub {shift() ** shift()},
	     );
  sub num {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    my $subr = $subr{$meth}
      or die "Do not know how to ($meth) in symbolic";
    $a = $a->num if ref $a eq __PACKAGE__;
    $b = $b->num if ref $b eq __PACKAGE__;
    $subr->($a,$b);
  }

All the work of numeric conversion is done in %subr and num().  Of
course, %subr is not complete, it contains only operators used in the
example below.  Here is the extra-credit question: why do we need an
explicit recursion in num()?  (Answer is at the end of this section.)

Use this module like this:

  require symbolic;
  my $iter = symbolic->new(2);	# 16-gon
  my $side = symbolic->new(1);
  my $cnt = $iter;

  while ($cnt) {
    $cnt = $cnt - 1;		# Mutator '--' not implemented
    $side = (sqrt(1 + $side**2) - 1)/$side;
  }
  printf "%s=%f\n", $side, $side;
  printf "pi=%f\n", $side*(2**($iter+2));

It prints (without so many line breaks)

  [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1] 2]]] 1]
			  [n 1]] 2]]] 1]
     [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1] 2]]] 1] [n 1]]]=0.198912
  pi=3.182598

The above module is very primitive.  It does not implement
mutator methods (C<++>, C<-=> and so on), does not do deep copying
(not required without mutators!), and implements only those arithmetic
operations which are used in the example.

To implement most arithmetic operations is easy; one should just use
the tables of operations, and change the code which fills %subr to

  my %subr = ( 'n' => sub {$_[0]} );
  foreach my $op (split " ", $overload::ops{with_assign}) {
    $subr{$op} = $subr{"$op="} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
  }
  my @bins = qw(binary 3way_comparison num_comparison str_comparison);
  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{ @bins }") {
    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
  }
  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{qw(unary func)}") {
    print "defining '$op'\n";
    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {$op shift()}";
  }

Since subroutines implementing assignment operators are not required
to modify their operands (see L</Overloadable Operations> above),
we do not need anything special to make C<+=> and friends work,
besides adding these operators to %subr and defining a copy
constructor (needed since Perl has no way to know that the
implementation of C<'+='> does not mutate the argument -
see L</Copy Constructor>).

To implement a copy constructor, add C<< '=' => \&cpy >> to C<use overload>
line, and code (this code assumes that mutators change things one level
deep only, so recursive copying is not needed):

  sub cpy {
    my $self = shift;
    bless [@$self], ref $self;
  }

To make C<++> and C<--> work, we need to implement actual mutators,
either directly, or in C<nomethod>.  We continue to do things inside
C<nomethod>, thus add

    if ($meth eq '++' or $meth eq '--') {
      @$obj = ($meth, (bless [@$obj]), 1); # Avoid circular reference
      return $obj;
    }

after the first line of wrap().  This is not a most effective
implementation, one may consider

  sub inc { $_[0] = bless ['++', shift, 1]; }

instead.

As a final remark, note that one can fill %subr by

  my %subr = ( 'n' => sub {$_[0]} );
  foreach my $op (split " ", $overload::ops{with_assign}) {
    $subr{$op} = $subr{"$op="} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
  }
  my @bins = qw(binary 3way_comparison num_comparison str_comparison);
  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{ @bins }") {
    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {shift() $op shift()}";
  }
  foreach my $op (split " ", "@overload::ops{qw(unary func)}") {
    $subr{$op} = eval "sub {$op shift()}";
  }
  $subr{'++'} = $subr{'+'};
  $subr{'--'} = $subr{'-'};

This finishes implementation of a primitive symbolic calculator in
50 lines of Perl code.  Since the numeric values of subexpressions
are not cached, the calculator is very slow.

Here is the answer for the exercise: In the case of str(), we need no
explicit recursion since the overloaded C<.>-operator will fall back
to an existing overloaded operator C<"">.  Overloaded arithmetic
operators I<do not> fall back to numeric conversion if C<fallback> is
not explicitly requested.  Thus without an explicit recursion num()
would convert C<['+', $a, $b]> to C<$a + $b>, which would just rebuild
the argument of num().

If you wonder why defaults for conversion are different for str() and
num(), note how easy it was to write the symbolic calculator.  This
simplicity is due to an appropriate choice of defaults.  One extra
note: due to the explicit recursion num() is more fragile than sym():
we need to explicitly check for the type of $a and $b.  If components
$a and $b happen to be of some related type, this may lead to problems.

=head2 I<Really> Symbolic Calculator

One may wonder why we call the above calculator symbolic.  The reason
is that the actual calculation of the value of expression is postponed
until the value is I<used>.

To see it in action, add a method

  sub STORE {
    my $obj = shift;
    $#$obj = 1;
    @$obj->[0,1] = ('=', shift);
  }

to the package C<symbolic>.  After this change one can do

  my $a = symbolic->new(3);
  my $b = symbolic->new(4);
  my $c = sqrt($a**2 + $b**2);

and the numeric value of $c becomes 5.  However, after calling

  $a->STORE(12);  $b->STORE(5);

the numeric value of $c becomes 13.  There is no doubt now that the module
symbolic provides a I<symbolic> calculator indeed.

To hide the rough edges under the hood, provide a tie()d interface to the
package C<symbolic>.  Add methods

  sub TIESCALAR { my $pack = shift; $pack->new(@_) }
  sub FETCH { shift }
  sub nop {  }		# Around a bug

(the bug, fixed in Perl 5.14, is described in L<"BUGS">).  One can use this
new interface as

  tie $a, 'symbolic', 3;
  tie $b, 'symbolic', 4;
  $a->nop;  $b->nop;	# Around a bug

  my $c = sqrt($a**2 + $b**2);

Now numeric value of $c is 5.  After C<$a = 12; $b = 5> the numeric value
of $c becomes 13.  To insulate the user of the module add a method

  sub vars { my $p = shift; tie($_, $p), $_->nop foreach @_; }

Now

  my ($a, $b);
  symbolic->vars($a, $b);
  my $c = sqrt($a**2 + $b**2);

  $a = 3; $b = 4;
  printf "c5  %s=%f\n", $c, $c;

  $a = 12; $b = 5;
  printf "c13  %s=%f\n", $c, $c;

shows that the numeric value of $c follows changes to the values of $a
and $b.

The C<overloading> pragma can be used to enable or disable overloaded
operations within a lexical scope - see L<overloading>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

When Perl is run with the B<-Do> switch or its equivalent, overloading
induces diagnostic messages.

Using the C<m> command of Perl debugger (see L<perldebug>) one can
deduce which operations are overloaded (and which ancestor triggers
this overloading).  Say, if C<eq> is overloaded, then the method C<(eq>
is shown by debugger.  The method C<()> corresponds to the C<fallback>
key (in fact a presence of this method shows that this package has
overloading enabled, and it is what is used by the C<Overloaded>
function of module C<overload>).

The module might issue the following warnings:

=over 4

=item Odd number of arguments for overload::constant

(W) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of arguments.
The arguments should come in pairs.

=item '%s' is not an overloadable type

(W) You tried to overload a constant type the overload package is unaware of.

=item '%s' is not a code reference
