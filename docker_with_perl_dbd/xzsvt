Kerberos Package Roadmap

  Most systems using Kerberos should install at least krb5-user, which
  contains the basic kinit, klist, and kdestroy binaries to manage user
  Kerberos credentials, as well as other basic utilities.  In order to
  use Kerberos passwords for local authentication and obtain Kerberos
  credentials automatically when logging in, install and configure
  libpam-krb5.

  To log on to other systems using Kerberos authentication, most sites
  will find a Kerberos-enabled sshd the most convenient. See the ssh documentation for information on enabling GSSAPI
  authentication (which is how Kerberos authentication is done over the
  ssh protocol).

  Some sites will instead prefer to use Kerberos-enabled versions of the
  standard Unix login utilities (rsh, rlogin, telnet, ftp).  The clients
  are available in the krb5-clients package and the servers are available
  in the krb5-rsh-server, krb5-telnetd, and krb5-ftpd packages.  Please
  note that the telnetd and ftpd included in those packages do not use PAM
  (this is not supported upstream and may or may not ever be supported);
  they only support Kerberos and will not run other PAM modules.  For more
  flexible login support, use Kerberos-enabled ssh instead.

  The krb5-kdc and krb5-admin-server packages are only needed and used on
  Kerberos KDCs, only one set of which is needed for each independently
  managed Kerberos realm.  For more information on how to set up a
  Kerberos realm using the Debian packages, install krb5-kdc and then read
  /usr/share/doc/krb5-kdc/README.KDC.

Documentation

  All Kerberos binaries and most configuration files have manual pages.
  For the info pages and reference manual, install krb5-doc.  If you need
  additional information, see <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/>.

Debian-Specific Information

  MIT distributes the Kerberos sources as a tarball and a PGP signature,
  tarred up into a single .tar file.  In order to create the Debian
  original upstream source (.orig.tar.gz), I untarred the parent tarball,
  checked the PGP signature, and used the contained tarball as the
  upstream source.  Since krb5-1.7, a separate "krb5-appl" tarball contains
  the kerberized client utilities (rlogin, rsh, etc.) with a similar
  nested-tarball scheme.

  MIT Kerberos is built against the libcom_err and libss provided by the
  e2fsprogs source package.  It is built against the version of db
  included in src/util/db2 in the Kerberos sources.  In the future,
  krb5-kdc may change to use db4, although doing so will make upgrades
  somewhat difficult.

  None of the sample clients and servers are installed.  As a general
  rule, these are not useful unless you are doing development, and in such
  a situation you probably want to build them from source.

  Note that by default, no unencrypted services are enabled.  That means,
  if you are using krb5-clients and the supporting server packages, you
  need to use rlogin -x to connect to a Debian system and if you use rsh
  or rcp without the -x option you will get an error that encryption is
  required.  In this day and age, not encrypting network traffic is a good
  way to get attacked.

  If installed, krb5-rsh-server by default allows any user in the local
  realm whose principal matches a local account name to log on to that
  account.  See the klogind and kshd man pages.  If this isn't the
  behavior you want, one option is to create an empty .k5login file in the
  home directory of every user and then add principals to those files
  where it's appropriate.  One way to do this for all newly created users
  is:

      touch /etc/skel/.k5login

  This will cause an empty .k5login file to be put in the home directory
  of newly created users.
