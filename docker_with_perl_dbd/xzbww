=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a convenient way to create directories of
arbitrary depth and to delete an entire directory subtree from the
filesystem.

The following functions are provided:

=over

=item make_path( $dir1, $dir2, .... )

=item make_path( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )

The C<make_path> function creates the given directories if they don't
exist before, much like the Unix command C<mkdir -p>.

The function accepts a list of directories to be created. Its
behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
parameter on the call.

The function returns the list of directories actually created during
the call; in scalar context the number of directories created.

The following keys are recognised in the option hash:

=over

=item mode => $num

The numeric permissions mode to apply to each created directory
(defaults to C<0777>), to be modified by the current C<umask>. If the
directory already exists (and thus does not need to be created),
the permissions will not be modified.

C<mask> is recognised as an alias for this parameter.

=item chmod => $num

Takes a numeric mode to apply to each created directory (not
modified by the current C<umask>). If the directory already exists
(and thus does not need to be created), the permissions will
not be modified.

=item verbose => $bool

If present, will cause C<make_path> to print the name of each directory
as it is created. By default nothing is printed.

=item error => \$err

If present, it should be a reference to a scalar.
This scalar will be made to reference an array, which will
be used to store any errors that are encountered.  See the L</"ERROR
HANDLING"> section for more information.

If this parameter is not used, certain error conditions may raise
a fatal error that will cause the program to halt, unless trapped
in an C<eval> block.

=item owner => $owner

=item user => $owner

=item uid => $owner

If present, will cause any created directory to be owned by C<$owner>.
If the value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a uid; otherwise a
username is assumed. An error will be issued if the username cannot be
mapped to a uid, the uid does not exist or the process lacks the
privileges to change ownership.

Ownership of directories that already exist will not be changed.

C<user> and C<uid> are aliases of C<owner>.

=item group => $group

If present, will cause any created directory to be owned by the group
C<$group>.  If the value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a gid;
otherwise a group name is assumed. An error will be issued if the
group name cannot be mapped to a gid, the gid does not exist or the
process lacks the privileges to change group ownership.

Group ownership of directories that already exist will not be changed.

    make_path '/var/tmp/webcache', {owner=>'nobody', group=>'nogroup'};

=back

=item mkpath( $dir )

=item mkpath( $dir, $verbose, $mode )

=item mkpath( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $mode )

=item mkpath( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )

The C<mkpath()> function provide the legacy interface of
C<make_path()> with a different interpretation of the arguments
passed.  The behaviour and return value of the function is otherwise
identical to C<make_path()>.

=item remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, .... )

=item remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )

The C<remove_tree> function deletes the given directories and any
files and subdirectories they might contain, much like the Unix
command C<rm -rf> or the Windows commands C<rmdir /s> and C<rd /s>.

The function accepts a list of directories to be removed. (In point of fact,
it will also accept filesystem entries which are not directories, such as
regular files and symlinks.  But, as its name suggests, its intent is to
remove trees rather than individual files.)

C<remove_tree()>'s behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref
appearing as the last parameter on the call.  If an empty string is
passed to C<remove_tree>, an error will occur.

B<NOTE:>  For security reasons, we strongly advise use of the
hashref-as-final-argument syntax -- specifically, with a setting of the C<safe>
element to a true value.

    remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ....,
        {
            safe => 1,
            ...         # other key-value pairs
        },
    );

The function returns the number of files successfully deleted.

The following keys are recognised in the option hash:

=over

=item verbose => $bool

If present, will cause C<remove_tree> to print the name of each file as
it is unlinked. By default nothing is printed.

=item safe => $bool

When set to a true value, will cause C<remove_tree> to skip the files
for which the process lacks the required privileges needed to delete
files, such as delete privileges on VMS. In other words, the code
will make no attempt to alter file permissions. Thus, if the process
is interrupted, no filesystem object will be left in a more
permissive mode.

=item keep_root => $bool

When set to a true value, will cause all files and subdirectories
to be removed, except the initially specified directories. This comes
in handy when cleaning out an application's scratch directory.

    remove_tree( '/tmp', {keep_root => 1} );

=item result => \$res

If present, it should be a reference to a scalar.
This scalar will be made to reference an array, which will
be used to store all files and directories unlinked
during the call. If nothing is unlinked, the array will be empty.

    remove_tree( '/tmp', {result => \my $list} );
    print "unlinked $_\n" for @$list;

This is a useful alternative to the C<verbose> key.

=item error => \$err

If present, it should be a reference to a scalar.
This scalar will be made to reference an array, which will
be used to store any errors that are encountered.  See the L</"ERROR
HANDLING"> section for more information.

Removing things is a much more dangerous proposition than
creating things. As such, there are certain conditions that
C<remove_tree> may encounter that are so dangerous that the only
sane action left is to kill the program.

Use C<error> to trap all that is reasonable (problems with
permissions and the like), and let it die if things get out
of hand. This is the safest course of action.

=back

=item rmtree( $dir )

=item rmtree( $dir, $verbose, $safe )

=item rmtree( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $safe )

=item rmtree( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )

The C<rmtree()> function provide the legacy interface of
C<remove_tree()> with a different interpretation of the arguments
passed. The behaviour and return value of the function is otherwise
identical to C<remove_tree()>.

B<NOTE:>  For security reasons, we strongly advise use of the
hashref-as-final-argument syntax, specifically with a setting of the C<safe>
element to a true value.

    rmtree( $dir1, $dir2, ....,
        {
            safe => 1,
            ...         # other key-value pairs
        },
    );

=head2 ERROR HANDLING

=over 4

=item B<NOTE:>

The following error handling mechanism is consistent throughout all
code paths EXCEPT in cases where the ROOT node is nonexistent.  In
version 2.11 the maintainers attempted to rectify this inconsistency
but too many downstream modules encountered problems.  In such case,
if you require root node evaluation or error checking prior to calling
C<make_path> or C<remove_tree>, you should take additional precautions.

=back

If C<make_path> or C<remove_tree> encounters an error, a diagnostic
message will be printed to C<STDERR> via C<carp> (for non-fatal
errors) or via C<croak> (for fatal errors).

If this behaviour is not desirable, the C<error> attribute may be
used to hold a reference to a variable, which will be used to store
the diagnostics. The variable is made a reference to an array of hash
references.  Each hash contain a single key/value pair where the key
is the name of the file, and the value is the error message (including
the contents of C<$!> when appropriate).  If a general error is
encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.

An example usage looks like:

  remove_tree( 'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error => \my $err} );
  if ($err && @$err) {
      for my $diag (@$err) {
          my ($file, $message) = %$diag;
          if ($file eq '') {
              print "general error: $message\n";
          }
          else {
              print "problem unlinking $file: $message\n";
          }
      }
  }
  else {
      print "No error encountered\n";
  }

Note that if no errors are encountered, C<$err> will reference an
empty array.  This means that C<$err> will always end up TRUE; so you
need to test C<@$err> to determine if errors occurred.

=head2 NOTES

C<File::Path> blindly exports C<mkpath> and C<rmtree> into the
current namespace. These days, this is considered bad style, but
to change it now would break too much code. Nonetheless, you are
invited to specify what it is you are expecting to use:

  use File::Path 'rmtree';

The routines C<make_path> and C<remove_tree> are B<not> exported
by default. You must specify which ones you want to use.

  use File::Path 'remove_tree';

Note that a side-effect of the above is that C<mkpath> and C<rmtree>
are no longer exported at all. This is due to the way the C<Exporter>
module works. If you are migrating a codebase to use the new
interface, you will have to list everything explicitly. But that's
just good practice anyway.

  use File::Path qw(remove_tree rmtree);

=head3 API CHANGES

The API was changed in the 2.0 branch. For a time, C<mkpath> and
C<rmtree> tried, unsuccessfully, to deal with the two different
calling mechanisms. This approach was considered a failure.

The new semantics are now only available with C<make_path> and
C<remove_tree>. The old semantics are only available through
C<mkpath> and C<rmtree>. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade
to at least 2.08 in order to avoid surprises.

=head3 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

There were race conditions in the 1.x implementations of File::Path's
C<rmtree> function (although sometimes patched depending on the OS
distribution or platform). The 2.0 version contains code to avoid the
problem mentioned in CVE-2002-0435.

See the following pages for more information:

    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286905
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2005/01/msg97623.html
    http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-696

Additionally, unless the C<safe> parameter is set (or the
third parameter in the traditional interface is TRUE), should a
C<remove_tree> be interrupted, files that were originally in read-only
mode may now have their permissions set to a read-write (or "delete
OK") mode.

The following CVE reports were previously filed against File-Path and are
believed to have been addressed:

=over 4

=item * L<http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2004-0452>

=item * L<http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2005-0448>

=back

In February 2017 the cPanel Security Team reported an additional vulnerability
in File-Path.  The C<chmod()> logic to make directories traversable can be
abused to set the mode on an attacker-chosen file to an attacker-chosen value.
This is due to the time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) race condition
(L<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use>) between the
C<stat()> that decides the inode is a directory and the C<chmod()> that tries
to make it user-rwx.  CPAN versions 2.13 and later incorporate a patch
