'autochdir' was only available when compiled with NetBeans and GUI.  Now it's
a separate feature, also available in the "big" version.

Added CTRL-W gf: open file under cursor in new tab page.

When using the menu in the tab pages line, "New Tab" opens the new tab before
where the click was.  Beyond the labels the new tab appears at the end instead
of after the current tab page.

Inside a mapping with an expression getchar() could not be used.

When vgetc is used recursively vgetc_busy protects it from being used
recursively.  But after a ":normal" command the protection was reset.

":s/a/b/n" didn't work when 'modifiable' was off.

When $VIMRUNTIME includes a multibyte character then rgb.txt could not be
found. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

":mkspell" didn't work correctly for non-ASCII affix flags when conversion is
needed on the spell file.

glob('/dir/\$ABC/*') didn't work.

When using several tab pages and changing 'cmdheight' the display could become
messed up.  Now store the value of 'cmdheight' separately for each tab page.

The user of the Enter key while the popup menu is visible was still confusing.
Now use Enter to select the match after using a cursor key.

Added "usetab" to 'switchbuf'.


--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0d ---

Added CTRL-W T: move a window to a new tab page.

Using CTRL-X s in Insert mode to complete spelling suggestions and using BS
deleted characters before the bad word.

A few small fixes for the VMS makefile. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

With a window of 91 lines 45 cols, ":vsp" scrolled the window.  Copy w_wrow
when splitting a window and skip setting the height when it's already at the
right value.

Using <silent> in a mapping with a shell command and the GUI caused redraw
to use wrong attributes.

Win32: Using MSVC 4.1 for install.exe resulted in the start menu items to be
created in the administrator directory instead of "All Users".  Define the
CSIDL_ items if they are missing.

Motif: The GUI tabline did not use the space above the right scrollbar.  Work
around a bug in the Motif library. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

The extra files for XML Omni completion are now also installed.
|xml-omni-datafile|

GTK GUI: when 'm' is missing from 'guioptions' during startup and pressing
<F10> GTK produced error messages.  Now do create the menu but disable it just
after the first gui_mch_update().

":mkspell" doesn't work well with the Hungarian dictionary from the Hunspell
project.  Back to the Myspell dictionary.

In help files hide the | used around tags.

Renamed pycomplete to pythoncomplete.

Added "tabpages" to 'sessionoptions'.

When 'guitablabel' is set the effect wasn't visible right away.

Fixed a few 'cindent' errors.

When completing menu names, e.g., after ":emenu", don't sort the entries but
keep them in the original order.

Fixed a crash when editing a directory in diff mode.  Don't trigger
autocommands when executing the diff command.

Getting a keystroke could get stuck if 'encoding' is a multibyte encoding and
typing a special key.

When 'foldignore' is set the folds were not updated right away.

When a list is indexed with [a : b] and b was greater than the length an error
message was given.  Now silently truncate the result.

When using BS during Insert mode completion go back to the original text, so
that CTRL-N selects the first matching entry.

Added the 'M' flag to 'cinoptions'.

Win32: Make the "gvim --help" window appear in the middle of the screen
instead of at an arbitrary position. (Randall W. Morris)

Added gettabwinvar() and settabwinvar().

Command line completion: pressing <Tab> after ":e /usr/*" expands the whole
tree, because it becomes ":e /usr/**".  Don't add a star if there already is
one.

Added grey10 to grey90 to all GUIs, so that they can all be used for
initializing highlighting.  Use grey40 for CursorColumn and CursorLine when
'background' is "dark".

When reading a file and using iconv for conversion, an incomplete byte
sequence at the end caused problems. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)


--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0e ---

Default color for MatchParen when 'background' is "dark" is now DarkCyan.

":syn off" had to be used twice in a file that sets 'syntax' in a modeline.
(Michael Geddes)

When using ":vsp" or ":sp" the available space wasn't used equally between
windows. (Servatius Brandt)

Expanding <cWORD> on a trailing blank resulted in the first word in the line
if 'encoding' is a multibyte encoding.

Spell checking: spellbadword() didn't see a missing capital in the first word
of a line.  Popup menu now only suggest the capitalized word when appropriate.

When using whole line completion CTRL-L moves through the matches but it
didn't work when at the original text.

When completion finds the longest match, don't go to the first match but stick
at the original text, so that CTRL-N selects the first one.

Recognize "zsh-beta" like "zsh" for setting the 'shellpipe' default. (James
Vega)

When using ":map <expr>" and the expression results in something with a
special byte (NUL or CSI) then it didn't work properly.  Now escape special
bytes.

The default Visual highlighting for a color xterm with 8 colors was a magenta
background, which made magenta text disappear.  Now use reverse in this
specific situation.

After completing the longest match "." didn't insert the same text.  Repeating
also didn't work correctly for multibyte text.

When using Insert mode completion and BS the whole word that was completed
would result in all possible matches.  Now stop completion.  Also fixes that
for spell completion the previous word was deleted.

GTK: When 'encoding' is "latin1" and using non-ASCII characters in a file name
the tab page label was wrong and an error message would be given.

The taglist() function could hang on a tags line with a non-ASCII character.

Win32: When 'encoding' differs from the system encoding tab page labels with
non-ASCII characters looked wrong. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Motif: building failed when Xm/Notebook.h doesn't exist.  Added a configure
check, disable GUI tabline when it's missing.

Mac: When compiled without multibyte feature the clipboard didn't work.

It was possible to switch to another tab page when the cmdline window is open.

Completion could hang when 'lines' is 6 and a preview window was opened.

Added CTRL-W gF: open file under cursor in new tab page and jump to the line
number following the file name.
Added 'guitabtooltip'.  Implemented for Win32 (Yegappan Lakshmanan).

Added "throw" to 'debug' option: throw an exception for error messages even
when they would otherwise be ignored.

When 'keymap' is set and a line contains an invalid entry could get a "No
mapping found" warning instead of a proper error message.

Motif: default to using XpmAttributes instead of XpmAttributes_21.

A few more changes for 64 bit MS-Windows. (George Reilly)

Got ml_get errors when doing "o" and selecting in other window where there are
less lines shorter than the cursor position in the other window.  ins_mouse()
was using position in wrong window.

Win32 GUI: Crash when giving a lot of messages during startup.  Allocate twice
as much memory for the dialog template.

Fixed a few leaks and wrong pointer use reported by coverity.

When showing menus the mode character was sometimes wrong.

Added feedkeys(). (Yakov Lerner)

Made matchlist() always return all submatches.

Moved triggering QuickFixCmdPost to before jumping to the first location.

Mac: Added the 'macatsui' option as a temporary work around for text drawing
problems.

Line completion on "/**" gave error messages when scanning an unloaded buffer.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0f ---

Win32: The height of the tab page labels is now adjusted to the font height.
(Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Win32: selecting the tab label was off by one. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Added tooltips for Motif and GTK tab page labels. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

When 'encoding' is "utf-8" then ":help spell" would report an illegal byte and
the file was not converted from latin1 to utf-8.  Now retry with latin1 if
reading the file as utf-8 results in illegal bytes.

Escape the argument of feedkeys() before putting it in the typeahead buffer.
(Yukihiro Nakadaira)

Added the v:char variable for evaluating 'formatexpr'. (Yukihiro Nakadaira)

With 8 colors Search highlighting combined with Statement highlighted text
made the text disappear.

VMS: avoid warnings for redefining MAX and MIN. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When 'virtualedit' includes "onemore", stopping Visual selection would still
move the cursor left.

Prevent that using CTRL-R = in Insert mode can start Visual mode.

Fixed a crash that occurred when in Insert mode with completion active and a
mapping caused edit() to be called recursively.

When using CTRL-O in Insert mode just after the last character while
'virtualedit' is "all", then typing CR moved the last character to the next
line.  Call coladvance() before starting the new line.

When using |:shell| ignore clicks on the tab page labels.  Also when using the
command line window.

When 'eventignore' is "all" then adding more to ignoring some events, e.g.,
for ":vimgrep", would actually trigger more events.

Win32: When a running Vim uses server name GVIM1 then "gvim --remote fname"
didn't find it.  When looking for a server name that doesn't end in a digit
and it is not found then use another server with that name and a number (just
like on Unix).

When using "double" in 'spellsuggest' when the language doesn't support sound
folding resulted in too many suggestions.

Win32: Dropping a shortcut on the Vim icon didn't edit the referred file like
editing it in another way would.  Use fname_expand() in buf_set_name() instead
of simply make the file name a full path.

Using feedkeys() could cause Vim to hang.

When closing another tab page from the tabline menu in Insert mode the tabline
was not updated right away.

The syntax menu didn't work in compatible mode.

After using ":tag id" twice with the same "id", ":ts" and then ":pop" a ":ts"
reported no matching tag.  Clear the cached tag name.

In Insert mode the matchparen plugin highlighted the wrong paren when there is
a string just next to a paren.

GTK: After opening a new tab page the text was sometimes not drawn correctly.
Flush output and catch up with events when updating the tab page labels.

In the GUI, using CTRL-W q to close the last window of a tab page could cause
a crash.

GTK: The tab pages line menu was not converted from 'encoding' to utf-8.

Typing a multibyte character or a special key at the hit-enter prompt did not
work.

When 'virtualedit' contains "onemore" CTRL-O in Insert mode still moved the
cursor left when it was after the end of the line, even though it's allowed to
be there.

Added test for using tab pages.

towupper() and towlower() were not used, because of checking for
__STDC__ISO_10646__ instead of __STDC_ISO_10646__. (sertacyildiz)

For ":map <expr>" forbid changing the text, jumping to another buffer and
using ":normal" to avoid nasty side effects.

--- fixes and changes since Vim 7.0g ---

Compilation error on HP-UX, use of "dlerr" must be inside a #ifdef.
(Gary Johnson)

Report +reltime feature in ":version" output.

The tar and zip plugins detect failure to get the contents of the archive and
edit the file as-is.

When the result of 'guitablabel' is empty fall back to the default label.

Fixed crash when using ":insert" in a while loop and missing "endwhile".

"gt" and other commands could move to another window when |textlock| active
and when the command line window was open.

Spell checking a file with syntax highlighting and a bad word at the end of
the line is ignored could make "]s" hang.

Mac: inputdialog() didn't work when compiled with big features.

Interrupting ":vimgrep" while it is busy loading a file left a modified and
hidden buffer behind.  Use enter_cleanup() and leave_cleanup() around
wipe_buffer().

When making 'keymap' empty the b:keymap_name variable wasn't deleted.

Using CTRL-N that searches a long time, pressing space to interrupt the
searching and accept the first match, the popup menu was still displayed
briefly.

When setting the Vim window height with -geometry the 'window' option could be
at a value that makes CTRL-F behave differently.

When opening a quickfix window in two tabs they used different buffers,
causing redrawing problems later.  Now use the same buffer for all quickfix
windows. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

When 'mousefocus' is set moving the mouse to the text tab pages line would
move focus to the first window.  Also, the mouse pointer would jump to the
active window.

In a session file, when an empty buffer is wiped out, do this silently.

When one window has the cursor on the last line and another window is resized
to make that window smaller, the cursor line could go below the displayed
lines.  In win_new_height() subtract one from the available space.
Also avoid that using "~" lines makes the window scroll down.

Mac: When sourcing the "macmap.vim" script and then finding a .vimrc file the
'cpo' option isn't set properly, because it was already set and restored.
Added the <special> argument to ":map", so that 'cpo' doesn't need to be
changed to be able to use <> notation.  Also do this for ":menu" for
consistency.

When using "/encoding=abc" in a spell word list, only "bc" was used.

When 'encoding' and 'printencoding' were both "utf-8" then ":hardcopy" didn't
work. (Mike Williams)

Mac: When building with "--disable-gui" the install directory would still be
"/Applications" and Vim.app would be installed.  Now install in /usr/local as
usual for a console application.

GUI: when doing completion and there is one match and still searching for
another, the cursor was displayed at the end of the line instead of after the
match.  Now show the cursor after the match while still searching for matches.

GUI: The mouse shape changed on the statusline even when 'mouse' was empty and
they can't be dragged.

GTK2: Selecting a button in the confirm() dialog with Tab or cursor keys and
hitting Enter didn't select that button.  Removed GTK 1 specific code. (Neil
Bird)

When evaluating 'balloonexpr' takes a long time it could be called
recursively, which could cause a crash.

exists() could not be used to detect whether ":2match" is supported.  Added a
check for it specifically.

GTK1: Tab page labels didn't work. (Yegappan Lakshmanan)

Insert mode completion: When finding matches use 'ignorecase', but when adding
matches to the list don't use it, so that all words with different case are
added, "word", "Word" and "WORD".

When 'cursorline' and 'hlsearch' are set and the search pattern is "x\n"
the rest of the line was highlighted as a match.

Cursor moved while evaluating 'balloonexpr' that invokes ":isearch" and
redirects the output.  Don't move the cursor to the command line if msg_silent
is set.

exists() ignored text after a function name and option name, which could
result in false positives.

exists() ignored characters after the recognized word, which can be wrong when
using a name with non-keyword characters.  Specifically, these calls no longer
allow characters after the name: exists('*funcname') exists('*funcname(...')
exists('&option') exists(':cmd') exists('g:name') exists('g:name[n]')
exists('g:name.n')

Trigger the TabEnter autocommand only after entering the current window of the
tab page, otherwise the commands are executed with an invalid current window.

Win32: When using two monitors and Vim is on the second monitor, changing the
width of the Vim window could make it jump to the first monitor.

When scrolling back at the more prompt and the quitting a line of text would
be left behind when 'cmdheight' is 2 or more.

Fixed a few things for Insert mode completion, especially when typing BS,
CTRL-N or a printable character while still searching for matches.

Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.009
Problem:    ml_get errors with both 'sidescroll' and 'spell' set.

Patch 7.0.035
Problem:    Insert mode completion works when typed but not when replayed from
	    a register. (Hari Krishna Dara)
	    Also: Mappings for Insert mode completion don't always work.
Solution:   When finding a non-completion key in the input don't interrupt
	    completion when it wasn't typed.
	    Do use mappings when checking for typeahead while still finding
	    completions.  Avoids that completion is interrupted too soon.
	    Use "compl_pending" in a different way.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 7.0.036
Problem:    Can't compile with small features and syntax highlighting or the
	    diff feature.
Solution:   Define LINE_ATTR whenever syntax highlighting or the diff feature

	    that doesn't fit.
Solution:   Don't redraw while the screen data is invalid.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 7.0.038
Problem:    When calling complete() from an Insert mode expression mapping
	    text could be inserted in an improper way.
Solution:   Make undo_allowed() global and use it in complete().
Files:	    src/undo.c, src/proto/undo.pro, src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.039
Problem:    Calling inputdialog() with a third argument in the console doesn't
	    work.
Solution:   Make a separate function for input() and inputdialog(). (Yegappan
	    Lakshmanan)
Files:	    src/eval.c
