=head2 C<watchfunction()>

C<watchfunction()> is a function that can be defined by the user; it is a
function which will be run on each entry to C<DB::DB>; it gets the
current package, filename, and line as its parameters.

The watchfunction can do anything it likes; it is executing in the
debugger's context, so it has access to all of the debugger's internal
data structures and functions.

C<watchfunction()> can control the debugger's actions. Any of the following
will cause the debugger to return control to the user's program after
C<watchfunction()> executes:

=over 4

=item *

Returning a false value from the C<watchfunction()> itself.

=item *

Altering C<$single> to a false value.

=item *

Altering C<$signal> to a false value.

=item *

Turning off the C<4> bit in C<$trace> (this also disables the
check for C<watchfunction()>. This can be done with

    $trace &= ~4;

=back

=cut

    # If there's a user-defined DB::watchfunction, call it with the
    # current package, filename, and line. The function executes in
    # the DB:: package.
    if ( $trace & 4 ) {    # User-installed watch
        return
          if watchfunction( $package, $filename, $line )
          and not $single

    } ## end if ($trace & 4)

    # Pick up any alteration to $signal in the watchfunction, and
    # turn off the signal now.
    $was_signal = $signal;
    $signal     = 0;

=head2 GETTING READY TO EXECUTE COMMANDS

The debugger decides to take control if single-step mode is on, the
C<t> command was entered, or the user generated a signal. If the program
has fallen off the end, we set things up so that entering further commands
won't cause trouble, and we say that the program is over.

=cut

    # Make sure that we always print if asked for explicitly regardless
    # of $trace_to_depth .
    $explicit_stop = ($single || $was_signal);

    # Check to see if we should grab control ($single true,
    # trace set appropriately, or we got a signal).
    if ( $explicit_stop || ( $trace & 1 ) ) {
        $obj->_DB__grab_control(@_);
    } ## end if ($single || ($trace...

=pod

If there's an action to be executed for the line we stopped at, execute it.
If there are any preprompt actions, execute those as well.

=cut

    # If there's an action, do it now.
    if ($action) {
        $evalarg = $action;
        # The &-call is here to ascertain the mutability of @_.
        &DB::eval;
    }
    undef $action;

    # Are we nested another level (e.g., did we evaluate a function
    # that had a breakpoint in it at the debugger prompt)?
    if ( $single || $was_signal ) {

        # Yes, go down a level.
        local $level = $level + 1;

        # Do any pre-prompt actions.
        foreach $evalarg (@$pre) {
            # The &-call is here to ascertain the mutability of @_.
            &DB::eval;
        }

        # Complain about too much recursion if we passed the limit.
        if ($single & 4) {
            print $OUT $stack_depth . " levels deep in subroutine calls!\n";
        }

        # The line we're currently on. Set $incr to -1 to stay here
        # until we get a command that tells us to advance.
        $start = $line;
        $incr  = -1;      # for backward motion.

        # Tack preprompt debugger actions ahead of any actual input.
        @typeahead = ( @$pretype, @typeahead );

=head2 WHERE ARE WE?

XXX Relocate this section?

The debugger normally shows the line corresponding to the current line of
execution. Sometimes, though, we want to see the next line, or to move elsewhere
in the file. This is done via the C<$incr>, C<$start>, and C<$max> variables.

C<$incr> controls by how many lines the I<current> line should move forward
after a command is executed. If set to -1, this indicates that the I<current>
line shouldn't change.

C<$start> is the I<current> line. It is used for things like knowing where to
move forwards or backwards from when doing an C<L> or C<-> command.

C<$max> tells the debugger where the last line of the current file is. It's
used to terminate loops most often.

=head2 THE COMMAND LOOP

Most of C<DB::DB> is actually a command parsing and dispatch loop. It comes
in two parts:

=over 4

=item *

The outer part of the loop, starting at the C<CMD> label. This loop
reads a command and then executes it.

=item *

The inner part of the loop, starting at the C<PIPE> label. This part
is wholly contained inside the C<CMD> block and only executes a command.
Used to handle commands running inside a pager.

=back

So why have two labels to restart the loop? Because sometimes, it's easier to
have a command I<generate> another command and then re-execute the loop to do
the new command. This is faster, but perhaps a bit more convoluted.

=cut

        # The big command dispatch loop. It keeps running until the
        # user yields up control again.
        #
        # If we have a terminal for input, and we get something back
        # from readline(), keep on processing.

      CMD:
        while (_DB__read_next_cmd($tid))
        {

            share($cmd);
            # ... try to execute the input as debugger commands.

            # Don't stop running.
            $single = 0;

            # No signal is active.
            $signal = 0;

            # Handle continued commands (ending with \):
            if ($cmd =~ s/\\\z/\n/) {
                $cmd .= DB::readline("  cont: ");
                redo CMD;
            }

=head4 The null command

A newline entered by itself means I<re-execute the last command>. We grab the
command out of C<$laststep> (where it was recorded previously), and copy it
back into C<$cmd> to be executed below. If there wasn't any previous command,
we'll do nothing below (no command will match). If there was, we also save it
in the command history and fall through to allow the command parsing to pick
it up.

=cut

            # Empty input means repeat the last command.
            if ($cmd eq '') {
                $cmd = $laststep;
            }
            chomp($cmd);    # get rid of the annoying extra newline
            if (length($cmd) >= option_val('HistItemMinLength', 2)) {
                push( @hist, $cmd );
            }
            push( @truehist, $cmd );
            share(@hist);
            share(@truehist);

            # This is a restart point for commands that didn't arrive
            # via direct user input. It allows us to 'redo PIPE' to
            # re-execute command processing without reading a new command.
          PIPE: {
                _DB__trim_command_and_return_first_component($obj);

=head3 COMMAND ALIASES

The debugger can create aliases for commands (these are stored in the
C<%alias> hash). Before a command is executed, the command loop looks it up
in the alias hash and substitutes the contents of the alias for the command,
completely replacing it.

=cut

                # See if there's an alias for the command, and set it up if so.
                if ( $alias{$cmd_verb} ) {

                    # Squelch signal handling; we want to keep control here
                    # if something goes loco during the alias eval.
                    local $SIG{__DIE__};
                    local $SIG{__WARN__};

                    # This is a command, so we eval it in the DEBUGGER's
                    # scope! Otherwise, we can't see the special debugger
                    # variables, or get to the debugger's subs. (Well, we
                    # _could_, but why make it even more complicated?)
                    eval "\$cmd =~ $alias{$cmd_verb}";
                    if ($@) {
                        local $\ = '';
                        print $OUT "Couldn't evaluate '$cmd_verb' alias: $@";
                        next CMD;
                    }
                    _DB__trim_command_and_return_first_component($obj);
                } ## end if ($alias{$cmd_verb})

=head3 MAIN-LINE COMMANDS

All of these commands work up to and after the program being debugged has
terminated.

=head4 C<q> - quit

Quit the debugger. This entails setting the C<$fall_off_end> flag, so we don't
try to execute further, cleaning any restart-related stuff out of the
environment, and executing with the last value of C<$?>.

=cut

                # All of these commands were remapped in perl 5.8.0;
                # we send them off to the secondary dispatcher (see below).
                $obj->_handle_special_char_cmd_wrapper_commands;
                _DB__trim_command_and_return_first_component($obj);

                if (my $cmd_rec = $cmd_lookup{$cmd_verb}) {
                    my $type = $cmd_rec->{t};
                    my $val = $cmd_rec->{v};
                    if ($type eq 'm') {
                        $obj->$val();
                    }
                    elsif ($type eq 's') {
                        $val->($obj);
                    }
                }

=head4 C<t> - trace [n]

Turn tracing on or off. Inverts the appropriate bit in C<$trace> (q.v.).
If level is specified, set C<$trace_to_depth>.

=head4 C<S> - list subroutines matching/not matching a pattern

Walks through C<%sub>, checking to see whether or not to print the name.

=head4 C<X> - list variables in current package

Since the C<V> command actually processes this, just change this to the
appropriate C<V> command and fall through.

=head4 C<V> - list variables

Uses C<dumpvar.pl> to dump out the current values for selected variables.

=head4 C<x> - evaluate and print an expression

Hands the expression off to C<DB::eval>, setting it up to print the value
via C<dumpvar.pl> instead of just printing it directly.

=head4 C<m> - print methods

Just uses C<DB::methods> to determine what methods are available.

=head4 C<f> - switch files

Switch to a different filename.

=head4 C<.> - return to last-executed line.

We set C<$incr> to -1 to indicate that the debugger shouldn't move ahead,
and then we look up the line in the magical C<%dbline> hash.

=head4 C<-> - back one window

We change C<$start> to be one window back; if we go back past the first line,
we set it to be the first line. We set C<$incr> to put us back at the
currently-executing line, and then put a S<C<l $start +>> (list one window from
C<$start>) in C<$cmd> to be executed later.

=head3 PRE-580 COMMANDS VS. NEW COMMANDS: C<a, A, b, B, h, l, L, M, o, O, P, v, w, W, E<lt>, E<lt>E<lt>, E<0x7B>, E<0x7B>E<0x7B>>

In Perl 5.8.0, a realignment of the commands was done to fix up a number of
problems, most notably that the default case of several commands destroying
the user's work in setting watchpoints, actions, etc. We wanted, however, to
retain the old commands for those who were used to using them or who preferred
them. At this point, we check for the new commands and call C<cmd_wrapper> to
deal with them instead of processing them in-line.

=head4 C<y> - List lexicals in higher scope

Uses C<PadWalker> to find the lexicals supplied as arguments in a scope
above the current one and then displays then using C<dumpvar.pl>.

=head3 COMMANDS NOT WORKING AFTER PROGRAM ENDS

All of the commands below this point don't work after the program being
debugged has ended. All of them check to see if the program has ended; this
allows the commands to be relocated without worrying about a 'line of
demarcation' above which commands can be entered anytime, and below which
they can't.

=head4 C<n> - single step, but don't trace down into subs

Done by setting C<$single> to 2, which forces subs to execute straight through
when entered (see C<DB::sub> in L</DEBUGGER INTERFACE VARIABLES>). We also
save the C<n> command in C<$laststep>,

so a null command knows what to re-execute.

=head4 C<s> - single-step, entering subs

Sets C<$single> to 1, which causes C<DB::sub> to continue tracing inside
subs. Also saves C<s> as C<$lastcmd>.

=head4 C<c> - run continuously, setting an optional breakpoint

Most of the code for this command is taken up with locating the optional
breakpoint, which is either a subroutine name or a line number. We set
the appropriate one-time-break in C<@dbline> and then turn off single-stepping
in this and all call levels above this one.

=head4 C<r> - return from a subroutine

For C<r> to work properly, the debugger has to stop execution again
immediately after the return is executed. This is done by forcing
single-stepping to be on in the call level above the current one. If
we are printing return values when a C<r> is executed, set C<$doret>
appropriately, and force us out of the command loop.

=head4 C<T> - stack trace

Just calls C<DB::print_trace>.

=head4 C<w> - List window around current line.

Just calls C<DB::cmd_w>.

=head4 C<W> - watch-expression processing.

Just calls C<DB::cmd_W>.

=head4 C</> - search forward for a string in the source

We take the argument and treat it as a pattern. If it turns out to be a
bad one, we return the error we got from trying to C<eval> it and exit.
If not, we create some code to do the search and C<eval> it so it can't
mess us up.

=cut

                _DB__handle_forward_slash_command($obj);

=head4 C<?> - search backward for a string in the source

Same as for C</>, except the loop runs backwards.

=cut

                _DB__handle_question_mark_command($obj);

=head4 C<$rc> - Recall command

Manages the commands in C<@hist> (which is created if C<Term::ReadLine> reports
that the terminal supports history). It finds the command required, puts it
into C<$cmd>, and redoes the loop to execute it.

=cut

                # $rc - recall command.
                $obj->_handle_rc_recall_command;

=head4 C<$sh$sh> - C<system()> command

Calls the C<_db_system()> to handle the command. This keeps the C<STDIN> and
C<STDOUT> from getting messed up.

=cut

                $obj->_handle_sh_command;

=head4 C<$rc I<pattern> $rc> - Search command history

Another command to manipulate C<@hist>: this one searches it with a pattern.
If a command is found, it is placed in C<$cmd> and executed via C<redo>.

=cut

                $obj->_handle_rc_search_history_command;

=head4 C<$sh> - Invoke a shell

Uses C<_db_system()> to invoke a shell.

=cut

=head4 C<$sh I<command>> - Force execution of a command in a shell

Like the above, but the command is passed to the shell. Again, we use
C<_db_system()> to avoid problems with C<STDIN> and C<STDOUT>.

=head4 C<H> - display commands in history

Prints the contents of C<@hist> (if any).

=head4 C<man, doc, perldoc> - look up documentation

Just calls C<runman()> to print the appropriate document.

=cut

                $obj->_handle_doc_command;

=head4 C<p> - print

Builds a C<print EXPR> expression in the C<$cmd>; this will get executed at
the bottom of the loop.

=head4 C<=> - define command alias

Manipulates C<%alias> to add or list command aliases.

=head4 C<source> - read commands from a file.

Opens a lexical filehandle and stacks it on C<@cmdfhs>; C<DB::readline> will
pick it up.

=head4 C<enable> C<disable> - enable or disable breakpoints

This enables or disables breakpoints.

=head4 C<save> - send current history to a file

Takes the complete history, (not the shrunken version you see with C<H>),
and saves it to the given filename, so it can be replayed using C<source>.

Note that all C<^(save|source)>'s are commented out with a view to minimise recursion.

=head4 C<R> - restart

Restart the debugger session.

=head4 C<rerun> - rerun the current session

Return to any given position in the B<true>-history list

=head4 C<|, ||> - pipe output through the pager.

For C<|>, we save C<OUT> (the debugger's output filehandle) and C<STDOUT>
(the program's standard output). For C<||>, we only save C<OUT>. We open a
pipe to the pager (restoring the output filehandles if this fails). If this
is the C<|> command, we also set up a C<SIGPIPE> handler which will simply
set C<$signal>, sending us back into the debugger.

We then trim off the pipe symbols and C<redo> the command loop at the
C<PIPE> label, causing us to evaluate the command in C<$cmd> without
reading another.

=cut

                # || - run command in the pager, with output to DB::OUT.
                _DB__handle_run_command_in_pager_command($obj);

=head3 END OF COMMAND PARSING

Anything left in C<$cmd> at this point is a Perl expression that we want to
evaluate. We'll always evaluate in the user's context, and fully qualify
any variables we might want to address in the C<DB> package.

=cut

            }    # PIPE:

            # trace an expression
            $cmd =~ s/^t\s/\$DB::trace |= 1;\n/;

            # Make sure the flag that says "the debugger's running" is
            # still on, to make sure we get control again.
            $evalarg = "\$^D = \$^D | \$DB::db_stop;\n$cmd";

            # Run *our* eval that executes in the caller's context.
            # The &-call is here to ascertain the mutability of @_.
            &DB::eval;

            # Turn off the one-time-dump stuff now.
            if ($onetimeDump) {
                $onetimeDump      = undef;
                $onetimedumpDepth = undef;
            }
            elsif ( $term_pid == $$ ) {
                eval { # May run under miniperl, when not available...
                    STDOUT->flush();
                    STDERR->flush();
                };

                # XXX If this is the master pid, print a newline.
                print {$OUT} "\n";
            }
        } ## end while (($term || &setterm...

=head3 POST-COMMAND PROCESSING

After each command, we check to see if the command output was piped anywhere.
If so, we go through the necessary code to unhook the pipe and go back to
our standard filehandles for input and output.

=cut

        continue {    # CMD:
            _DB__at_end_of_every_command($obj);
        }    # CMD:

=head3 COMMAND LOOP TERMINATION

When commands have finished executing, we come here. If the user closed the
input filehandle, we turn on C<$fall_off_end> to emulate a C<q> command. We
evaluate any post-prompt items. We restore C<$@>, C<$!>, C<$^E>, C<$,>, C<$/>,
C<$\>, and C<$^W>, and return a null list as expected by the Perl interpreter.
The interpreter will then execute the next line and then return control to us
again.

=cut

        # No more commands? Quit.
        $fall_off_end = 1 unless defined $cmd;    # Emulate 'q' on EOF

        # Evaluate post-prompt commands.
        foreach $evalarg (@$post) {
            # The &-call is here to ascertain the mutability of @_.
            &DB::eval;
        }
    }    # if ($single || $signal)

    # Put the user's globals back where you found them.
    ( $@, $!, $^E, $,, $/, $\, $^W ) = @saved;
    ();
