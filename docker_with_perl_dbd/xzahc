   Return "True" if the string is empty or all characters in the
   string are ASCII, "False" otherwise. ASCII characters have code
   points in the range U+0000-U+007F.

   New in version 3.7.

str.isdecimal()

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are decimal
   characters and there is at least one character, "False" otherwise.
   Decimal characters are those that can be used to form numbers in
   base 10, e.g. U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO.  Formally a decimal
   character is a character in the Unicode General Category ‚ÄúNd‚Äù.

str.isdigit()

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are digits and there
   is at least one character, "False" otherwise.  Digits include
   decimal characters and digits that need special handling, such as
   the compatibility superscript digits. This covers digits which
   cannot be used to form numbers in base 10, like the Kharosthi
   numbers.  Formally, a digit is a character that has the property
   value Numeric_Type=Digit or Numeric_Type=Decimal.

str.isidentifier()

   Return "True" if the string is a valid identifier according to the
   language definition, section Identifiers and keywords.

   Call "keyword.iskeyword()" to test whether string "s" is a reserved
   identifier, such as "def" and "class".

   Example:

      >>> from keyword import iskeyword

      >>> 'hello'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('hello')
      (True, False)
      >>> 'def'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('def')
      (True, True)

str.islower()

   Return "True" if all cased characters [4] in the string are
   lowercase and there is at least one cased character, "False"
   otherwise.

str.isnumeric()

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are numeric
   characters, and there is at least one character, "False" otherwise.
   Numeric characters include digit characters, and all characters
   that have the Unicode numeric value property, e.g. U+2155, VULGAR
   FRACTION ONE FIFTH.  Formally, numeric characters are those with
   the property value Numeric_Type=Digit, Numeric_Type=Decimal or
   Numeric_Type=Numeric.

str.isprintable()

   Return "True" if all characters in the string are printable or the
   string is empty, "False" otherwise.  Nonprintable characters are
   those characters defined in the Unicode character database as
   ‚ÄúOther‚Äù or ‚ÄúSeparator‚Äù, excepting the ASCII space (0x20) which is
   considered printable.  (Note that printable characters in this
   context are those which should not be escaped when "repr()" is
   invoked on a string.  It has no bearing on the handling of strings
   written to "sys.stdout" or "sys.stderr".)

str.isspace()

   Return "True" if there are only whitespace characters in the string
   and there is at least one character, "False" otherwise.

   A character is *whitespace* if in the Unicode character database
   (see "unicodedata"), either its general category is "Zs"
   (‚ÄúSeparator, space‚Äù), or its bidirectional class is one of "WS",
   "B", or "S".

str.istitle()

   Return "True" if the string is a titlecased string and there is at
   least one character, for example uppercase characters may only
   follow uncased characters and lowercase characters only cased ones.
   Return "False" otherwise.

str.isupper()

   Return "True" if all cased characters [4] in the string are
   uppercase and there is at least one cased character, "False"
   otherwise.

   >>> 'BANANA'.isupper()
   True
   >>> 'banana'.isupper()
   False
   >>> 'baNana'.isupper()
   False
   >>> ' '.isupper()
   False

str.join(iterable)

   Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in
   *iterable*. A "TypeError" will be raised if there are any non-
   string values in *iterable*, including "bytes" objects.  The
   separator between elements is the string providing this method.

str.ljust(width[, fillchar])

   Return the string left justified in a string of length *width*.
   Padding is done using the specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII
   space). The original string is returned if *width* is less than or
   equal to "len(s)".

str.lower()

   Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4]
   converted to lowercase.

   The lowercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the
   Unicode Standard.

str.lstrip([chars])

   Return a copy of the string with leading characters removed.  The
   *chars* argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be
   removed.  If omitted or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to
   removing whitespace.  The *chars* argument is not a prefix; rather,
   all combinations of its values are stripped:

      >>> '   spacious   '.lstrip()
      'spacious   '
      >>> 'www.example.com'.lstrip('cmowz.')
      'example.com'

   See "str.removeprefix()" for a method that will remove a single
   prefix string rather than all of a set of characters.  For example:

      >>> 'Arthur: three!'.lstrip('Arthur: ')
      'ee!'
      >>> 'Arthur: three!'.removeprefix('Arthur: ')
      'three!'

static str.maketrans(x[, y[, z]])

   This static method returns a translation table usable for
   "str.translate()".

   If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping
   Unicode ordinals (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to
   Unicode ordinals, strings (of arbitrary lengths) or "None".
   Character keys will then be converted to ordinals.

   If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length,
   and in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped
   to the character at the same position in y.  If there is a third
   argument, it must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to
   "None" in the result.

str.partition(sep)

   Split the string at the first occurrence of *sep*, and return a
   3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator
   itself, and the part after the separator.  If the separator is not
   found, return a 3-tuple containing the string itself, followed by
   two empty strings.

str.removeprefix(prefix, /)

   If the string starts with the *prefix* string, return
   "string[len(prefix):]". Otherwise, return a copy of the original
   string:

      >>> 'TestHook'.removeprefix('Test')
      'Hook'
      >>> 'BaseTestCase'.removeprefix('Test')
      'BaseTestCase'

   New in version 3.9.

str.removesuffix(suffix, /)

   If the string ends with the *suffix* string and that *suffix* is
   not empty, return "string[:-len(suffix)]". Otherwise, return a copy
   of the original string:

      >>> 'MiscTests'.removesuffix('Tests')
      'Misc'
      >>> 'TmpDirMixin'.removesuffix('Tests')
      'TmpDirMixin'

   New in version 3.9.

str.replace(old, new[, count])

   Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring *old*
   replaced by *new*.  If the optional argument *count* is given, only
   the first *count* occurrences are replaced.

str.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])

   Return the highest index in the string where substring *sub* is
   found, such that *sub* is contained within "s[start:end]".
   Optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as in slice
   notation.  Return "-1" on failure.

str.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])

   Like "rfind()" but raises "ValueError" when the substring *sub* is
   not found.

str.rjust(width[, fillchar])

   Return the string right justified in a string of length *width*.
   Padding is done using the specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII
   space). The original string is returned if *width* is less than or
   equal to "len(s)".

str.rpartition(sep)

   Split the string at the last occurrence of *sep*, and return a
   3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator
   itself, and the part after the separator.  If the separator is not
   found, return a 3-tuple containing two empty strings, followed by
   the string itself.

str.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)

   Return a list of the words in the string, using *sep* as the
   delimiter string. If *maxsplit* is given, at most *maxsplit* splits
   are done, the *rightmost* ones.  If *sep* is not specified or
   "None", any whitespace string is a separator.  Except for splitting
   from the right, "rsplit()" behaves like "split()" which is
   described in detail below.

str.rstrip([chars])

   Return a copy of the string with trailing characters removed.  The
   *chars* argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be
   removed.  If omitted or "None", the *chars* argument defaults to
   removing whitespace.  The *chars* argument is not a suffix; rather,
   all combinations of its values are stripped:

      >>> '   spacious   '.rstrip()
      '   spacious'
      >>> 'mississippi'.rstrip('ipz')
      'mississ'

   See "str.removesuffix()" for a method that will remove a single
   suffix string rather than all of a set of characters.  For example:

      >>> 'Monty Python'.rstrip(' Python')
      'M'
      >>> 'Monty Python'.removesuffix(' Python')
      'Monty'

str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)

   Return a list of the words in the string, using *sep* as the
   delimiter string.  If *maxsplit* is given, at most *maxsplit*
   splits are done (thus, the list will have at most "maxsplit+1"
   elements).  If *maxsplit* is not specified or "-1", then there is
   no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).

   If *sep* is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together
   and are deemed to delimit empty strings (for example,
   "'1,,2'.split(',')" returns "['1', '', '2']").  The *sep* argument
   may consist of multiple characters (for example,
   "'1<>2<>3'.split('<>')" returns "['1', '2', '3']"). Splitting an
   empty string with a specified separator returns "['']".

   For example:

      >>> '1,2,3'.split(',')
      ['1', '2', '3']
      >>> '1,2,3'.split(',', maxsplit=1)
      ['1', '2,3']
      >>> '1,2,,3,'.split(',')
      ['1', '2', '', '3', '']

   If *sep* is not specified or is "None", a different splitting
   algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded
   as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings
   at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing
   whitespace.  Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string
   consisting of just whitespace with a "None" separator returns "[]".

   For example:

      >>> '1 2 3'.split()
      ['1', '2', '3']
      >>> '1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)
      ['1', '2 3']
      >>> '   1   2   3   '.split()
      ['1', '2', '3']

str.splitlines(keepends=False)

   Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line
   boundaries.  Line breaks are not included in the resulting list
   unless *keepends* is given and true.

   This method splits on the following line boundaries.  In
   particular, the boundaries are a superset of *universal newlines*.

   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Representation          | Description                   |
   |=========================|===============================|
   | "\n"                    | Line Feed                     |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\r"                    | Carriage Return               |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\r\n"                  | Carriage Return + Line Feed   |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\v" or "\x0b"          | Line Tabulation               |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\f" or "\x0c"          | Form Feed                     |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x1c"                  | File Separator                |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x1d"                  | Group Separator               |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x1e"                  | Record Separator              |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\x85"                  | Next Line (C1 Control Code)   |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\u2028"                | Line Separator                |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
   | "\u2029"                | Paragraph Separator           |
   +-------------------------+-------------------------------+

   Changed in version 3.2: "\v" and "\f" added to list of line
   boundaries.

   For example:

      >>> 'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines()
      ['ab c', '', 'de fg', 'kl']
      >>> 'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines(keepends=True)
      ['ab c\n', '\n', 'de fg\r', 'kl\r\n']

   Unlike "split()" when a delimiter string *sep* is given, this
   method returns an empty list for the empty string, and a terminal
   line break does not result in an extra line:

      >>> "".splitlines()
      []
      >>> "One line\n".splitlines()
      ['One line']

   For comparison, "split('\n')" gives:

      >>> ''.split('\n')
      ['']
      >>> 'Two lines\n'.split('\n')
      ['Two lines', '']

str.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])

   Return "True" if string starts with the *prefix*, otherwise return
   "False". *prefix* can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for.
   With optional *start*, test string beginning at that position.
   With optional *end*, stop comparing string at that position.

str.strip([chars])

   Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing
   characters removed. The *chars* argument is a string specifying the
   set of characters to be removed. If omitted or "None", the *chars*
   argument defaults to removing whitespace. The *chars* argument is
   not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are
   stripped:

      >>> '   spacious   '.strip()
      'spacious'
      >>> 'www.example.com'.strip('cmowz.')
      'example'

   The outermost leading and trailing *chars* argument values are
   stripped from the string. Characters are removed from the leading
   end until reaching a string character that is not contained in the
   set of characters in *chars*. A similar action takes place on the
   trailing end. For example:

      >>> comment_string = '#....... Section 3.2.1 Issue #32 .......'
      >>> comment_string.strip('.#! ')
      'Section 3.2.1 Issue #32'

str.swapcase()

   Return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to
   lowercase and vice versa. Note that it is not necessarily true that
   "s.swapcase().swapcase() == s".

str.title()

   Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an
   uppercase character and the remaining characters are lowercase.

   For example:

      >>> 'Hello world'.title()
      'Hello World'

   The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a
   word as groups of consecutive letters.  The definition works in
   many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and
   possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired
   result:

      >>> "they're bill's friends from the UK".title()
      "They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk"

   The "string.capwords()" function does not have this problem, as it
   splits words on spaces only.

   Alternatively, a workaround for apostrophes can be constructed
   using regular expressions:

      >>> import re
      >>> def titlecase(s):
      ...     return re.sub(r"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?",
      ...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0).capitalize(),
      ...                   s)
      ...
      >>> titlecase("they're bill's friends.")
      "They're Bill's Friends."

str.translate(table)

   Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped
   through the given translation table.  The table must be an object
   that implements indexing via "__getitem__()", typically a *mapping*
   or *sequence*.  When indexed by a Unicode ordinal (an integer), the
   table object can do any of the following: return a Unicode ordinal
   or a string, to map the character to one or more other characters;
   return "None", to delete the character from the return string; or
   raise a "LookupError" exception, to map the character to itself.

   You can use "str.maketrans()" to create a translation map from
   character-to-character mappings in different formats.

   See also the "codecs" module for a more flexible approach to custom
   character mappings.

str.upper()

   Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4]
   converted to uppercase.  Note that "s.upper().isupper()" might be
   "False" if "s" contains uncased characters or if the Unicode
   category of the resulting character(s) is not ‚ÄúLu‚Äù (Letter,
   uppercase), but e.g. ‚ÄúLt‚Äù (Letter, titlecase).

   The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the
   Unicode Standard.

str.zfill(width)

   Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII "'0'" digits to
   make a string of length *width*. A leading sign prefix
   ("'+'"/"'-'") is handled by inserting the padding *after* the sign
   character rather than before. The original string is returned if
   *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

   For example:

      >>> "42".zfill(5)
      '00042'
      >>> "-42".zfill(5)
      '-0042'
⁄stringsu¬"  String and Bytes literals
*************************

String literals are described by the following lexical definitions:

   stringliteral   ::= [stringprefix](shortstring | longstring)
   stringprefix    ::= "r" | "u" | "R" | "U" | "f" | "F"
                    | "fr" | "Fr" | "fR" | "FR" | "rf" | "rF" | "Rf" | "RF"
   shortstring     ::= "'" shortstringitem* "'" | '"' shortstringitem* '"'
   longstring      ::= "'''" longstringitem* "'''" | '"""' longstringitem* '"""'
   shortstringitem ::= shortstringchar | stringescapeseq
   longstringitem  ::= longstringchar | stringescapeseq
   shortstringchar ::= <any source character except "\" or newline or the quote>
   longstringchar  ::= <any source character except "\">
   stringescapeseq ::= "\" <any source character>

   bytesliteral   ::= bytesprefix(shortbytes | longbytes)
   bytesprefix    ::= "b" | "B" | "br" | "Br" | "bR" | "BR" | "rb" | "rB" | "Rb" | "RB"
   shortbytes     ::= "'" shortbytesitem* "'" | '"' shortbytesitem* '"'
   longbytes      ::= "'''" longbytesitem* "'''" | '"""' longbytesitem* '"""'
   shortbytesitem ::= shortbyteschar | bytesescapeseq
   longbytesitem  ::= longbyteschar | bytesescapeseq
   shortbyteschar ::= <any ASCII character except "\" or newline or the quote>
   longbyteschar  ::= <any ASCII character except "\">
   bytesescapeseq ::= "\" <any ASCII character>

One syntactic restriction not indicated by these productions is that
whitespace is not allowed between the "stringprefix" or "bytesprefix"
and the rest of the literal. The source character set is defined by
the encoding declaration; it is UTF-8 if no encoding declaration is
given in the source file; see section Encoding declarations.

In plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching
single quotes ("'") or double quotes (""").  They can also be enclosed
in matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are
generally referred to as *triple-quoted strings*).  The backslash
("\") character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a
special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote
character.

Bytes literals are always prefixed with "'b'" or "'B'"; they produce
an instance of the "bytes" type instead of the "str" type.  They may
only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or
greater must be expressed with escapes.

Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a
letter "'r'" or "'R'"; such strings are called *raw strings* and treat
backslashes as literal characters.  As a result, in string literals,
"'\U'" and "'\u'" escapes in raw strings are not treated specially.
Given that Python 2.x‚Äôs raw unicode literals behave differently than
Python 3.x‚Äôs the "'ur'" syntax is not supported.

New in version 3.3: The "'rb'" prefix of raw bytes literals has been
added as a synonym of "'br'".

New in version 3.3: Support for the unicode legacy literal
("u'value'") was reintroduced to simplify the maintenance of dual
Python 2.x and 3.x codebases. See **PEP 414** for more information.

A string literal with "'f'" or "'F'" in its prefix is a *formatted
string literal*; see Formatted string literals.  The "'f'" may be
combined with "'r'", but not with "'b'" or "'u'", therefore raw
formatted strings are possible, but formatted bytes literals are not.

In triple-quoted literals, unescaped newlines and quotes are allowed
(and are retained), except that three unescaped quotes in a row
terminate the literal.  (A ‚Äúquote‚Äù is the character used to open the
literal, i.e. either "'" or """.)

Unless an "'r'" or "'R'" prefix is present, escape sequences in string
and bytes literals are interpreted according to rules similar to those
used by Standard C.  The recognized escape sequences are:

Notes:

1. A backslash can be added at the end of a line to ignore the
   newline:

      >>> 'This string will not include \
      ... backslashes or newline characters.'
      'This string will not include backslashes or newline characters.'

   The same result can be achieved using triple-quoted strings, or
   parentheses and string literal concatenation.

2. As in Standard C, up to three octal digits are accepted.

   Changed in version 3.11: Octal escapes with value larger than
   "0o377" produce a "DeprecationWarning". In a future Python version
   they will be a "SyntaxWarning" and eventually a "SyntaxError".

3. Unlike in Standard C, exactly two hex digits are required.

4. In a bytes literal, hexadecimal and octal escapes denote the byte
   with the given value. In a string literal, these escapes denote a
   Unicode character with the given value.

5. Changed in version 3.3: Support for name aliases [1] has been
   added.

6. Exactly four hex digits are required.

7. Any Unicode character can be encoded this way.  Exactly eight hex
   digits are required.

Unlike Standard C, all unrecognized escape sequences are left in the
string unchanged, i.e., *the backslash is left in the result*.  (This
behavior is useful when debugging: if an escape sequence is mistyped,
the resulting output is more easily recognized as broken.)  It is also
important to note that the escape sequences only recognized in string
literals fall into the category of unrecognized escapes for bytes
literals.

   Changed in version 3.6: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a
   "DeprecationWarning".  In a future Python version they will be a
   "SyntaxWarning" and eventually a "SyntaxError".

Even in a raw literal, quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the
backslash remains in the result; for example, "r"\""" is a valid
string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double
quote; "r"\"" is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot
end in an odd number of backslashes).  Specifically, *a raw literal
cannot end in a single backslash* (since the backslash would escape
the following quote character).  Note also that a single backslash
followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part
of the literal, *not* as a line continuation.
⁄subscriptionsuá	  Subscriptions
*************

The subscription of an instance of a container class will generally
select an element from the container. The subscription of a *generic
class* will generally return a GenericAlias object.

   subscription ::= primary "[" expression_list "]"

When an object is subscripted, the interpreter will evaluate the
primary and the expression list.

The primary must evaluate to an object that supports subscription. An
object may support subscription through defining one or both of
"__getitem__()" and "__class_getitem__()". When the primary is
subscripted, the evaluated result of the expression list will be
passed to one of these methods. For more details on when
"__class_getitem__" is called instead of "__getitem__", see
__class_getitem__ versus __getitem__.

If the expression list contains at least one comma, it will evaluate
to a "tuple" containing the items of the expression list. Otherwise,
the expression list will evaluate to the value of the list‚Äôs sole
member.

For built-in objects, there are two types of objects that support
subscription via "__getitem__()":

1. Mappings. If the primary is a *mapping*, the expression list must
   evaluate to an object whose value is one of the keys of the
   mapping, and the subscription selects the value in the mapping that
   corresponds to that key. An example of a builtin mapping class is
   the "dict" class.

2. Sequences. If the primary is a *sequence*, the expression list must
   evaluate to an "int" or a "slice" (as discussed in the following
   section). Examples of builtin sequence classes include the "str",
   "list" and "tuple" classes.

The formal syntax makes no special provision for negative indices in
*sequences*. However, built-in sequences all provide a "__getitem__()"
method that interprets negative indices by adding the length of the
sequence to the index so that, for example, "x[-1]" selects the last
item of "x". The resulting value must be a nonnegative integer less
than the number of items in the sequence, and the subscription selects
the item whose index is that value (counting from zero). Since the
support for negative indices and slicing occurs in the object‚Äôs
"__getitem__()" method, subclasses overriding this method will need to
explicitly add that support.

A "string" is a special kind of sequence whose items are *characters*.
A character is not a separate data type but a string of exactly one
character.
⁄truthax  Truth Value Testing
*******************

Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an "if" or
"while" condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.

By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines
either a "__bool__()" method that returns "False" or a "__len__()"
method that returns zero, when called with the object. [1]  Here are
most of the built-in objects considered false:

* constants defined to be false: "None" and "False".

* zero of any numeric type: "0", "0.0", "0j", "Decimal(0)",
  "Fraction(0, 1)"

* empty sequences and collections: "''", "()", "[]", "{}", "set()",
  "range(0)"

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always
return "0" or "False" for false and "1" or "True" for true, unless
otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations "or"
and "and" always return one of their operands.)
⁄tryuÙ  The "try" statement
*******************

The "try" statement specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code
for a group of statements:

   try_stmt  ::= try1_stmt | try2_stmt | try3_stmt
   try1_stmt ::= "try" ":" suite
                 ("except" [expression ["as" identifier]] ":" suite)+
                 ["else" ":" suite]
                 ["finally" ":" suite]
   try2_stmt ::= "try" ":" suite
                 ("except" "*" expression ["as" identifier] ":" suite)+
                 ["else" ":" suite]
                 ["finally" ":" suite]
   try3_stmt ::= "try" ":" suite
                 "finally" ":" suite

Additional information on exceptions can be found in section
Exceptions, and information on using the "raise" statement to generate
exceptions may be found in section The raise statement.


"except" clause
===============

The "except" clause(s) specify one or more exception handlers. When no
exception occurs in the "try" clause, no exception handler is
executed. When an exception occurs in the "try" suite, a search for an
exception handler is started. This search inspects the "except"
clauses in turn until one is found that matches the exception. An
expression-less "except" clause, if present, must be last; it matches
any exception. For an "except" clause with an expression, that
expression is evaluated, and the clause matches the exception if the
resulting object is ‚Äúcompatible‚Äù with the exception.  An object is
compatible with an exception if the object is the class or a *non-
virtual base class* of the exception object, or a tuple containing an
item that is the class or a non-virtual base class of the exception
object.

If no "except" clause matches the exception, the search for an
exception handler continues in the surrounding code and on the
invocation stack.  [1]

If the evaluation of an expression in the header of an "except" clause
raises an exception, the original search for a handler is canceled and
a search starts for the new exception in the surrounding code and on
the call stack (it is treated as if the entire "try" statement raised
the exception).

When a matching "except" clause is found, the exception is assigned to
the target specified after the "as" keyword in that "except" clause,
if present, and the "except" clause‚Äôs suite is executed. All "except"
clauses must have an executable block. When the end of this block is
reached, execution continues normally after the entire "try"
statement. (This means that if two nested handlers exist for the same
exception, and the exception occurs in the "try" clause of the inner
handler, the outer handler will not handle the exception.)

When an exception has been assigned using "as target", it is cleared
at the end of the "except" clause.  This is as if

   except E as N:
       foo

was translated to

   except E as N:
       try:
           foo
       finally:
           del N

This means the exception must be assigned to a different name to be
able to refer to it after the "except" clause. Exceptions are cleared
because with the traceback attached to them, they form a reference
cycle with the stack frame, keeping all locals in that frame alive
until the next garbage collection occurs.

Before an "except" clause‚Äôs suite is executed, details about the
exception are stored in the "sys" module and can be accessed via
"sys.exc_info()". "sys.exc_info()" returns a 3-tuple consisting of the
exception class, the exception instance and a traceback object (see
section The standard type hierarchy) identifying the point in the
program where the exception occurred.  The details about the exception
accessed via "sys.exc_info()" are restored to their previous values
when leaving an exception handler:

   >>> print(sys.exc_info())
   (None, None, None)
   >>> try:
   ...     raise TypeError
   ... except:
   ...     print(sys.exc_info())
   ...     try:
   ...          raise ValueError
   ...     except:
   ...         print(sys.exc_info())
   ...     print(sys.exc_info())
   ...
   (<class 'TypeError'>, TypeError(), <traceback object at 0x10efad080>)
   (<class 'ValueError'>, ValueError(), <traceback object at 0x10efad040>)
   (<class 'TypeError'>, TypeError(), <traceback object at 0x10efad080>)
   >>> print(sys.exc_info())
   (None, None, None)


"except*" clause
================

The "except*" clause(s) are used for handling "ExceptionGroup"s. The
exception type for matching is interpreted as in the case of "except",
but in the case of exception groups we can have partial matches when
the type matches some of the exceptions in the group. This means that
multiple "except*" clauses can execute, each handling part of the
exception group. Each clause executes at most once and handles an
exception group of all matching exceptions.  Each exception in the
group is handled by at most one "except*" clause, the first that
matches it.

   >>> try:
   ...     raise ExceptionGroup("eg",
   ...         [ValueError(1), TypeError(2), OSError(3), OSError(4)])
   ... except* TypeError as e:
   ...     print(f'caught {type(e)} with nested {e.exceptions}')
   ... except* OSError as e:
   ...     print(f'caught {type(e)} with nested {e.exceptions}')
   ...
   caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'> with nested (TypeError(2),)
   caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'> with nested (OSError(3), OSError(4))
     + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last):
     |   File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
     | ExceptionGroup: eg
     +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
       | ValueError: 1
       +------------------------------------

Any remaining exceptions that were not handled by any "except*" clause
are re-raised at the end, combined into an exception group along with
all exceptions that were raised from within "except*" clauses.

If the raised exception is not an exception group and its type matches
one of the "except*" clauses, it is caught and wrapped by an exception
group with an empty message string.

   >>> try:
   ...     raise BlockingIOError
   ... except* BlockingIOError as e:
   ...     print(repr(e))
   ...
   ExceptionGroup('', (BlockingIOError()))

An "except*" clause must have a matching type, and this type cannot be
a subclass of "BaseExceptionGroup". It is not possible to mix "except"
and "except*" in the same "try". "break", "continue" and "return"
cannot appear in an "except*" clause.


"else" clause
=============

The optional "else" clause is executed if the control flow leaves the
"try" suite, no exception was raised, and no "return", "continue", or
"break" statement was executed.  Exceptions in the "else" clause are
not handled by the preceding "except" clauses.


"finally" clause
================

If "finally" is present, it specifies a ‚Äòcleanup‚Äô handler.  The "try"
clause is executed, including any "except" and "else" clauses.  If an
exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the
exception is temporarily saved. The "finally" clause is executed.  If
there is a saved exception it is re-raised at the end of the "finally"
clause.  If the "finally" clause raises another exception, the saved
exception is set as the context of the new exception. If the "finally"
clause executes a "return", "break" or "continue" statement, the saved
exception is discarded:

   >>> def f():
   ...     try:
   ...         1/0
   ...     finally:
   ...         return 42
   ...
   >>> f()
   42

The exception information is not available to the program during
execution of the "finally" clause.

When a "return", "break" or "continue" statement is executed in the
"try" suite of a "try"‚Ä¶"finally" statement, the "finally" clause is
also executed ‚Äòon the way out.‚Äô

The return value of a function is determined by the last "return"
statement executed.  Since the "finally" clause always executes, a
"return" statement executed in the "finally" clause will always be the
last one executed:

   >>> def foo():
   ...     try:
   ...         return 'try'
   ...     finally:
   ...         return 'finally'
   ...
   >>> foo()
   'finally'

Changed in version 3.8: Prior to Python 3.8, a "continue" statement
was illegal in the "finally" clause due to a problem with the
implementation.
u’°  The standard type hierarchy
***************************

Below is a list of the types that are built into Python.  Extension
modules (written in C, Java, or other languages, depending on the
implementation) can define additional types.  Future versions of
Python may add types to the type hierarchy (e.g., rational numbers,
efficiently stored arrays of integers, etc.), although such additions
will often be provided via the standard library instead.

Some of the type descriptions below contain a paragraph listing
‚Äòspecial attributes.‚Äô  These are attributes that provide access to the
implementation and are not intended for general use.  Their definition
may change in the future.

None
   This type has a single value.  There is a single object with this
   value. This object is accessed through the built-in name "None". It
   is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g.,
   it is returned from functions that don‚Äôt explicitly return
   anything. Its truth value is false.

NotImplemented
   This type has a single value.  There is a single object with this
   value. This object is accessed through the built-in name
   "NotImplemented". Numeric methods and rich comparison methods
   should return this value if they do not implement the operation for
   the operands provided.  (The interpreter will then try the
   reflected operation, or some other fallback, depending on the
   operator.)  It should not be evaluated in a boolean context.

   See Implementing the arithmetic operations for more details.

   Changed in version 3.9: Evaluating "NotImplemented" in a boolean
   context is deprecated. While it currently evaluates as true, it
   will emit a "DeprecationWarning". It will raise a "TypeError" in a
   future version of Python.

Ellipsis
   This type has a single value.  There is a single object with this
   value. This object is accessed through the literal "..." or the
   built-in name "Ellipsis".  Its truth value is true.

"numbers.Number"
   These are created by numeric literals and returned as results by
   arithmetic operators and arithmetic built-in functions.  Numeric
   objects are immutable; once created their value never changes.
   Python numbers are of course strongly related to mathematical
   numbers, but subject to the limitations of numerical representation
   in computers.

   The string representations of the numeric classes, computed by
   "__repr__()" and "__str__()", have the following properties:

   * They are valid numeric literals which, when passed to their class
     constructor, produce an object having the value of the original
     numeric.

   * The representation is in base 10, when possible.

   * Leading zeros, possibly excepting a single zero before a decimal
     point, are not shown.

   * Trailing zeros, possibly excepting a single zero after a decimal
     point, are not shown.

   * A sign is shown only when the number is negative.

   Python distinguishes between integers, floating point numbers, and
   complex numbers:
