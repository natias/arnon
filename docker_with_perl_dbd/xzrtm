 -----------------------------------------------------------
 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
 creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
 a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
 partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
 any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .

 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components

 files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .

 Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
 Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
 creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
 a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
 partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
 any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
