   DESCRIPTION:
        This function deallocates all the memory allocated for an OTS instance,
        including the null structure.

        FOR PERSISTENT OBJECTS:
        This function will return an error if the client is attempting to free 
        a dirty persistent object that has not been flushed. The client should 
        either flush the persistent object or set the parameter 'flag' to  
        OCI_OBJECT_FREE_FORCE.

        This function will call OCIObjectUnpin() once to check if the object 
        can be completely unpin. If it succeeds, the rest of the function will 
        proceed to free the object.  If it fails, then an error is returned 
        unless the parameter 'flag' is set to OCI_OBJECT_FREE_FORCE.
 
        Freeing a persistent object in memory will not change the persistent 
        state of that object at the server.  For example, the object will 
        remain locked after the object is freed.

        FOR TRANSIENT OBJECTS:

        This function will call OCIObjectUnpin() once to check if the object

        proceed to free the object.  If it fails, then an error is returned

   DESCRIPTION:
        This function refreshes an unmarked object with data retrieved from the
        latest snapshot in the server. An object should be refreshed when the 
        objects in the cache are inconsistent with the objects at 
        the server:
        1) When an object is flushed to the server, triggers can be fired to
           modify more objects in the server.  The same objects (modified by 
           the triggers) in the object cache become obsolete.
        2) When the user issues a SQL or executes a PL/SQL procedure to modify
           any object in the server, the same object in the cache becomes
           obsolete.

        The object that is refreshed will be 'replaced-in-place'. When an
        object is 'replaced-in-place', the top level memory of the object will 
        be reused so that new data can be loaded into the same memory address. 
        The top level memory of the null structre is also reused. Unlike the
        top level memory chunk, the secondary memory chunks may be resized and
        reallocated.  The client should be careful when holding onto a pointer 
        to the secondary memory chunk (e.g. assigning the address of a 
        secondary memory to a local variable), since this pointer can become 
        invalid after the object is refreshed.

        The object state will be modified as followed after being refreshed: 
          - existent : set to appropriate value
          - pinned   : unchanged 
          - allocation duration : unchanged 
          - pin duration : unchanged

                             the size is fixed.
   DESCRIPTION:
        This function returns the specified property of the object.
        The desired property is identified by 'propertyId'. The property
        value is copied into 'property' and for string typed properties
        the string size is returned via 'size'. 
        
        Objects are classified as persistent, transient and value
        depending upon the lifetime and referenceability of the object.
        Some of the properties are applicable only to persistent
        objects and some others only apply to persistent and 
        transient objects. An error is returned if the user tries to 
        get a property which in not applicable to the given object. 
        To avoid such an error, the user should first check whether
        the object is persistent or transient or value 
        (OCI_OBJECTPROP_LIFETIME property) and then appropriately
        query for other properties.

        The different property ids and the corresponding type of 
        'property' argument is given below.

          OCI_OBJECTPROP_LIFETIME 
            This identifies whether the given object is a persistent
            object (OCI_OBJECT_PERSISTENT) or a 
            transient object (OCI_OBJECT_TRANSIENT) or a
            value instance (OCI_OBJECT_VALUE).
            'property' argument must be a pointer to a variable of 
            type OCIObjectLifetime.
            
          OCI_OBJECTPROP_SCHEMA
            This returns the schema name of the table in which the 
            object exists. An error is returned if the given object 
            points to a transient instance or a value. If the input 
            buffer is not big enough to hold the schema name an error 
            is returned, the error message will communicate the 
            required size. Upon success, the size of the returned 
            schema name in bytes is returned via 'size'.
            'property' argument must be an array of type text and 'size'
            should be set to size of array in bytes by the caller.

          OCI_OBJECTPROP_TABLE
            This returns the table name in which the object exists. An 
            error is returned if the given object points to a 
            transient instance or a value. If the input buffer is not 
            big enough to hold the table name an error is returned, 
            the error message will communicate the required size. Upon 
            success, the size of the returned table name in bytes is 
            returned via 'size'. 'property' argument must be an array 
            of type text and 'size' should be set to size of array in 
            bytes by the caller.
            
          OCI_OBJECTPROP_PIN_DURATION
            This returns the pin duration of the object.
            An error is returned if the given object points to a value 
            instance. Valid pin durations are: OCI_DURATION_SESSION and
            OCI_DURATION_TRANS.
            'property' argument must be a pointer to a variable of type 
            OCIDuration.
            
          OCI_OBJECTPROP_ALLOC_DURATION
            This returns the allocation duration of the object.
            Valid allocation durations are: OCI_DURATION_SESSION and
            OCI_DURATION_TRANS.
            'property' argument must be a pointer to a variable of type 
            OCIDuration.
            
          OCI_OBJECTPROP_LOCK
            This returns the lock status of the 
            object. The possible lock status is enumerated by OCILockOpt.
            An error is returned if the given object points to a transient
            or value instance.
            'property' argument must be a pointer to a variable of 
            type OCILockOpt.
            Note, the lock status of an object can also be retrieved by
            calling OCIObjectIsLocked().

          OCI_OBJECTPROP_MARKSTATUS
            This returns the status flag which indicates whether the
            object is a new object, updated object and/or deleted object.
            The following macros can be used to test the mark status
            flag:

              OCI_OBJECT_IS_UPDATED(flag)
              OCI_OBJECT_IS_DELETED(flag)
              OCI_OBJECT_IS_NEW(flag)
              OCI_OBJECT_IS_DIRTY(flag)

            An object is dirty if it is a new object or marked deleted or 
            marked updated.
            An error is returned if the given object points to a transient
            or value instance. 'property' argument must be of type 
            OCIObjectMarkStatus.
            
          OCI_OBJECTPROP_VIEW
            This identifies whether the specified object is a view object
            or not. If property value returned is TRUE, it indicates the
            object is a view otherwise it is not.
            'property' argument must be of type boolean.

   RETURNS:
        if environment handle or error handle is null, return
        OCI_INVALID_HANDLE.
        if operation suceeds, return OCI_SUCCESS.
        if operation fails, return OCI_ERROR. Possible errors are TBD

   REQUIRES:
        - a valid OCI environment handle must be given for non-cartridge
          services.
        - For cartridge services, NULL should be given for environment handle
        - A valid service handle must be given in all cases.
   DESCRIPTION:
        This function starts a new user duration.  A user can have multiple
        active user durations simultaneously. The user durations do not have
        to be nested.
 
        The object subsystem predefines 3 durations :
          1) session     - memory allocated with session duration comes from
                           the UGA heap (OCI_DURATION_SESSION). A session 
                           duration terminates at the end of the user session.
          2) transaction - memory allocated with transaction duration comes
                           from the UGA heap (OCI_DURATION_TRANS). A trans-
                           action duration terminates at the end of the user
                           transaction.
          3) call        - memory allocated with call duration comes from PGA
                           heap (OCI_DURATION_CALL). A call duration terminates
                           at the end of the user call.
 
        Each user duration has a parent duration.  A parent duration can be a
        predefined duration or another user duration.  The relationship between
        a user duration and its parent duration (child duration) are:
 
         1) An user duration is nested within the parent duration. When its
             parent duration terminates, the user duration will also terminate.
         2) The memory allocated with an user duration comes from the heap of
             its parent duration. For example, if the parent duration of an
             user duration is call, then the memory allocated with the user
             duration will also come from the PGA heap.

        This function can be used as both part of cartridge services as well 
        as without cartridge services.
        The difference in the function in the case of cartridge and 
        non-cartridge services is:
                In case of cartridge services, as descibed above a new user
        duration is created as a child of the "parent" duration.
                But when used for non-cartridge purposes, when a pre-defined
        duration is passed in as parent, it is mapped to the cache duration
        for that connection (which is created if not already present) and 
        the new user duration will be child of the cache duration.
