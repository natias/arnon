to its local copy of that certificate.  Systems that have obtained
a copy of your certificate with the User ID that you are trying to
strip will not drop that User ID from their copy.)

In most cases, you will want to use the 'sq revoke userid' operation
instead.  That issues a revocation for a User ID, which can be used to mark
the User ID as invalidated.

However, this operation can be useful in very specific cases, in particular:
to remove a mistakenly added User ID before it has been uploaded to key
servers or otherwise shared.

Stripping a User ID may change how a certificate is interpreted.  This
is because information about the certificate like algorithm preferences,
the primary key's key flags, etc. is stored in the User ID's binding
signature.
EXAMPLES:

# First, this generates a key
$ sq key generate --userid "<juliet@example.org>" --export juliet.key.pgp

# Then, this strips a User ID
$ sq key userid strip --userid "<juliet@example.org>" \
  --output juliet-new.key.pgp juliet.key.pgp

TIME is interpreted as an ISO 8601 timestamp.  To set the creation
time to June 28, 2022 at midnight UTC, you can do:

$ sq key userid add --userid "Juliet" --creation-time 20210628 \
   juliet.key.pgp --output juliet-new.key.pgp

To include a time, add a T, the time and optionally the timezone (the

$ sq key userid add --userid "Juliet" --creation-time 20210628T1137+0200 \
   juliet.key.pgp --output juliet-new.key.pgp
Adds a User IDAdds a User ID

A User ID can contain a name, like "Juliet" or an email address, like
"<juliet@example.org>".  Historically, a name and email address were often
combined as a single User ID, like "Juliet <juliet@example.org>".
EXAMPLES:

# First, this generates a key
$ sq key generate --userid "<juliet@example.org>" --export juliet.key.pgp

# Then, this adds a User ID
$ sq key userid add --userid "Juliet" juliet.key.pgp \
  --output juliet-new.key.pgp

After generating a key, use this command to get the certificate
corresponding to the key.  The key must be kept secure, while the
certificate should be handed out to correspondents, e.g. by uploading
it to a keyserver.
EXAMPLES:

# First, this generates a key

$ sq key extract-cert --output juliet.cert.pgp juliet.key.pgp

Secret key material in keys can be protected by a password.  This

To emit the key with unencrypted secrets, either use `--clear` or
supply a zero-length password when prompted for the new password.
EXAMPLES:

# First, generate a key
$ sq key generate --userid "<juliet@example.org>" --export juliet.key.pgp

# Then, encrypt the secrets in the key with a password.
$ sq key password < juliet.key.pgp > juliet.encrypted_key.pgp

Generating a key is the prerequisite to receiving encrypted messages
and creating signatures.  There are a few parameters to this process,
but we provide reasonable defaults for most users.

When generating a key, we also generate a revocation certificate.
This can be used in case the key is superseded, lost, or compromised.
It is a good idea to keep a copy of this in a safe place.

After generating a key, use "sq key extract-cert" to get the
certificate corresponding to the key.  The key must be kept secure,
while the certificate should be handed out to correspondents, e.g. by
uploading it to a keyserver.
EXAMPLES:

# First, this generates a key
$ sq key generate --userid "<juliet@example.org>" --export juliet.key.pgp

# Then, this extracts the certificate for distribution
$ sq key extract-cert --output juliet.cert.pgp juliet.key.pgp

# Generates a key protecting it with a password
$ sq key generate --userid "<juliet@example.org>" --with-password

# Generates a key with multiple userids
$ sq key generate --userid "<juliet@example.org>" --userid "Juliet Capulet"

We use the term "key" to refer to OpenPGP keys that do contain
secrets.  This subcommand provides primitives to generate and
otherwise manipulate keys.

Conversely, we use the term "certificate", or cert for short, to refer
to OpenPGP keys that do not contain secrets.  See "sq keyring" for
operations on certificates.

Splitting up a keyring into individual keys helps with curating a
keyring.

The converse operation is "sq keyring join".

$ sq keyring split certs.pgp

# Split all certs, merging them first to avoid duplicates
$ sq keyring merge certs.pgp | sq keyring split

$ sq keyring filter --domain example.org certs.pgp | sq keyring list

Unlike "sq keyring join", the certificates are buffered and multiple

replaced (e.g., secret key material), data from the later certificate
is preferred.

# Merge certificate updates

Converting a key to a certificate removes secret key material from the key thereby turning it into a certificate.Joins keys into a keyring applying a filterJoins keys into a keyring applying a filter

This can be used to filter keys based on given predicates,
e.g. whether they have a user id containing an email address with a
certain domain.  Additionally, the keys can be pruned to only include
components matching the predicates.

If no filters are supplied, everything matches.

If multiple predicates are given, they are or'ed, i.e. a key matches
if any of the predicates match.  To require all predicates to match,
chain multiple invocations of this command.  See EXAMPLES for
inspiration.
EXAMPLES:

# Converts a key to a cert (i.e., remove any secret key material)
$ sq keyring filter --to-cert cat juliet.pgp

# Gets the keys with a user id on example.org
$ sq keyring filter --domain example.org keys.pgp

# Gets the keys with a user id on example.org or example.net

Collections of keys or certficicates (also known as "keyrings" when
they contain secret key material, and "certrings" when they don't) are
any number of concatenated certificates.  This subcommand provides
tools to list, split, join, merge, and filter keyrings.

Note: In the documentation of this subcommand, we sometimes use the
terms keys and certs interchangeably.

Using a certification a keyholder may vouch for the fact that another
certificate legitimately belongs to a user id.  In the context of
emails this means that the same entity controls the key and the email
address.  These kind of certifications form the basis for the Web Of
Trust.

This command emits the certificate with the new certification.  The
updated certificate has to be distributed, preferably by sending it to
the certificate holder for attestation.  See also "sq key
attest-certification".

# Juliet certifies that Romeo controls romeo.pgp and romeo@example.org

Generates revocation certificatesGenerates revocation certificates.

A revocation certificate indicates that a certificate, a subkey, a
User ID, or a signature should not be used anymore.

A revocation certificate includes two fields, a type and a
human-readable explanation, which allows the issuer to indicate why
the revocation certificate was issued.  It is important to set the
type field accurately as this allows an OpenPGP implementation to
better reason about artifacts whose validity relies on the revoked
object.  For instance, if a certificate is retired, it is reasonable
to consider signatures that it made prior to its retirement as still
being valid.  However, if a certificate's secret key material is
compromised, any signatures that it made should be considered
potentially forged, as they could have been made by an attacker and
backdated.

As the intent of a revocation certificate is to stop others from using
a certificate, it is necessary to distribute the revocation
certificate.  One effective way to do this is to upload the revocation
certificate to a keyserver.
EXAMPLES:

# Revoke a certificate.
$ sq revoke certificate --time 20220101 --certificate juliet.pgp \
  compromised "My parents went through my things, and found my backup."

# Revoke a User ID.
$ sq revoke userid --time 20220101 --certificate juliet.pgp \

When verifying signed messages, the message is written to stdout or
the file given to --output.

When a detached message is verified, no output is produced.  Detached
signatures are often used to sign software packages.

Verification is only successful if there is no bad signature, and the
number of successfully verified signatures reaches the threshold
configured with the "--signatures" parameter.  If the verification
fails, the program terminates with an exit status indicating failure.
In addition to that, the last 25 MiB of the message are withheld,
i.e. if the message is smaller than 25 MiB, no output is produced, and
if it is larger, then the output will be truncated.

The converse operation is "sq sign".
