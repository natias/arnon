Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 Most users wishing to build applications against MIT Kerberos should
 install libkrb5-dev.  However, that package conflicts with heimdal-dev.
 This package installs libraries and headers in /usr/include/mit-krb5 and
 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which
 provides the same facilities for Heimdal.

Description: Perl module for manipulation of ZIP archives
 The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
 read, and write Zip archive files.
 .
 Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
 Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.
 .
 Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and
 enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments,
 or other attributes queried or modified.  Their data can be
 compressed or uncompressed as needed.  Members can be created from
 members in existing Zip files, or from existing directories, files,
 or strings.

Description: Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)
    * zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib)
    * mtree (read and write)
    * shar (write only)
    * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
    * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)
 .
 Filters supported are:
 .
    * gzip (read and write, uses zlib)
    * bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)
    * compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)
    * uudecode (read only)
    * separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection
    * xz and lzma (read and write using liblzma)
    * zstandard (read and write using libzstd)
 .
 This package provides the libarchive shared library.

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
