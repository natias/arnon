/*
 * The device migration Finite State Machine is described by the enum
 * vfio_device_mig_state. Some of the FSM arcs will create a migration data
 * transfer session by returning a FD, in this case the migration data will
 * flow over the FD using read() and write() as discussed below.
 *
 * There are 5 states to support VFIO_MIGRATION_STOP_COPY:
 *  RUNNING - The device is running normally
 *  STOP - The device does not change the internal or external state
 *  STOP_COPY - The device internal state can be read out
 *  RESUMING - The device is stopped and is loading a new internal state
 *  ERROR - The device has failed and must be reset
 *
 * And 1 optional state to support VFIO_MIGRATION_P2P:
 *  RUNNING_P2P - RUNNING, except the device cannot do peer to peer DMA
 *
 * The FSM takes actions on the arcs between FSM states. The driver implements
 * the following behavior for the FSM arcs:
 *
 * RUNNING_P2P -> STOP
 * STOP_COPY -> STOP
 *   While in STOP the device must stop the operation of the device. The device
 *   must not generate interrupts, DMA, or any other change to external state.
 *   It must not change its internal state. When stopped the device and kernel
 *   migration driver must accept and respond to interaction to support external
 *   subsystems in the STOP state, for example PCI MSI-X and PCI config space.
 *   Failure by the user to restrict device access while in STOP must not result
 *   in error conditions outside the user context (ex. host system faults).
 *
 *   The STOP_COPY arc will terminate a data transfer session.
 *
 * RESUMING -> STOP
 *   Leaving RESUMING terminates a data transfer session and indicates the
 *   device should complete processing of the data delivered by write(). The
 *   kernel migration driver should complete the incorporation of data written
 *   to the data transfer FD into the device internal state and perform
 *   final validity and consistency checking of the new device state. If the
 *   user provided data is found to be incomplete, inconsistent, or otherwise
 *   invalid, the migration driver must fail the SET_STATE ioctl and
 *   optionally go to the ERROR state as described below.
 *
 *   While in STOP the device has the same behavior as other STOP states
 *   described above.
 *
 *   To abort a RESUMING session the device must be reset.
 *
 * RUNNING_P2P -> RUNNING
 *   While in RUNNING the device is fully operational, the device may generate
 *   interrupts, DMA, respond to MMIO, all vfio device regions are functional,
 *   and the device may advance its internal state.
 *
 * RUNNING -> RUNNING_P2P
 * STOP -> RUNNING_P2P
 *   While in RUNNING_P2P the device is partially running in the P2P quiescent
 *   state defined below.
 *
 * STOP -> STOP_COPY
 *   This arc begin the process of saving the device state and will return a
 *   new data_fd.
 *
 *   While in the STOP_COPY state the device has the same behavior as STOP
 *   with the addition that the data transfers session continues to stream the
 *   migration state. End of stream on the FD indicates the entire device
 *   state has been transferred.
 *
 *   The user should take steps to restrict access to vfio device regions while
 *   the device is in STOP_COPY or risk corruption of the device migration data
 *   stream.
 *
 * STOP -> RESUMING
 *   Entering the RESUMING state starts a process of restoring the device state
 *   and will return a new data_fd. The data stream fed into the data_fd should
 *   be taken from the data transfer output of a single FD during saving from
 *   a compatible device. The migration driver may alter/reset the internal
 *   device state for this arc if required to prepare the device to receive the
 *   migration data.
 *
 * any -> ERROR
 *   ERROR cannot be specified as a device state, however any transition request
 *   can be failed with an errno return and may then move the device_state into
 *   ERROR. In this case the device was unable to execute the requested arc and
 *   was also unable to restore the device to any valid device_state.
 *   To recover from ERROR VFIO_DEVICE_RESET must be used to return the
 *   device_state back to RUNNING.
 *
 * The optional peer to peer (P2P) quiescent state is intended to be a quiescent
 * state for the device for the purposes of managing multiple devices within a
 * user context where peer-to-peer DMA between devices may be active. The
 * RUNNING_P2P states must prevent the device from initiating
 * any new P2P DMA transactions. If the device can identify P2P transactions
 * then it can stop only P2P DMA, otherwise it must stop all DMA. The migration
 * driver must complete any such outstanding operations prior to completing the
 * FSM arc into a P2P state. For the purpose of specification the states
 * behave as though the device was fully running if not supported. Like while in
 * STOP or STOP_COPY the user must not touch the device, otherwise the state
 * can be exited.
 *
 * The remaining possible transitions are interpreted as combinations of the
 * above FSM arcs. As there are multiple paths through the FSM arcs the path
 * should be selected based on the following rules:
 *   - Select the shortest path.
 * Refer to vfio_mig_get_next_state() for the result of the algorithm.
 *
 * The automatic transit through the FSM arcs that make up the combination
 * transition is invisible to the user. When working with combination arcs the
 * user may see any step along the path in the device_state if SET_STATE
 * fails. When handling these types of errors users should anticipate future
 * revisions of this protocol using new states and those states becoming
 * visible in this case.
 *
 * The optional states cannot be used with SET_STATE if the device does not
 * support them. The user can discover if these states are supported by using
 * VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIGRATION. By using combination transitions the user can
 * avoid knowing about these optional states if the kernel driver supports them.

 * VFIO_DMA_UNMAP_FLAG_GET_DIRTY_BITMAP should be set to get the dirty bitmap
 * before unmapping IO virtual addresses. When this flag is set, the user must

 * memory via vfio_bitmap.data and its size in the vfio_bitmap.size field.
 * A bit in the bitmap represents one page, of user provided page size in
 * vfio_bitmap.pgsize field, consecutively starting from iova offset. Bit set
 * indicates that the page at that offset from iova is dirty. A Bitmap of the
 * pages in the range of unmapped size is returned in the user-provided
 * vfio_bitmap.data.
 *
 * If flags & VFIO_DMA_UNMAP_FLAG_ALL, unmap all addresses.  iova and size
 * must be 0.  This cannot be combined with the get-dirty-bitmap flag.
 *
 * If flags & VFIO_DMA_UNMAP_FLAG_VADDR, do not unmap, but invalidate host
 * virtual addresses in the iova range.  DMA to already-mapped pages continues.
 * Groups may not be added to the container while any addresses are invalid.

 * the device; designed to be used when a migration is in progress. Dirty pages
 * are logged until logging is disabled by user application by calling the IOCTL
 * with VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_STOP flag.
 *
 * Calling the IOCTL with VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_STOP flag set, instructs
 * the IOMMU driver to stop logging dirtied pages.
 *
 * Calling the IOCTL with VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES_FLAG_GET_BITMAP flag set
 * returns the dirty pages bitmap for IOMMU container for a given IOVA range.
 * The user must specify the IOVA range and the pgsize through the structure
 * vfio_iommu_type1_dirty_bitmap_get in the data[] portion. This interface
 * supports getting a bitmap of the smallest supported pgsize only and can be
 * modified in future to get a bitmap of any specified supported pgsize. The
 * user must provide a zeroed memory area for the bitmap memory and specify its
 * size in bitmap.size. One bit is used to represent one page consecutively
 * starting from iova offset. The user should provide page size in bitmap.pgsize
 * field. A bit set in the bitmap indicates that the page at that offset from
 * iova is dirty. The caller must set argsz to a value including the size of
 * structure vfio_iommu_type1_dirty_bitmap_get, but excluding the size of the
 * actual bitmap. If dirty pages logging is not enabled, an error will be
 * returned.
 *
