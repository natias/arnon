	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/ex_docmd.c, src/proto/window.pro, src/window.c

Patch 6.2.186 (after 6.2.185)
Problem:    Documentation file eval.txt contains examples without indent.
Solution:   Insert the indent.  Also fix other mistakes.
Files:	    runtime/doc/eval.txt

Patch 6.2.187
Problem:    Using Insure++ reveals a number of bugs.  (Dominique Pelle)
Solution:   Initialize variables where needed.  Free allocated memory to avoid
	    leaks.  Fix comparing tags to avoid reading past allocated memory.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/diff.c, src/fileio.c, src/mark.c, src/misc1.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/ops.c, src/option.c, src/tag.c, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.189
Problem:    When setting 'viminfo' after editing a new buffer its marks are
	    not stored. (Keith Roberts)
Solution:   Set the "b_marks_read" flag when skipping to read marks from the
	    viminfo file.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.190
Problem:    When editing a compressed files, marks are lost.
Solution:   Add the ":lockmarks" modifier and use it in the gzip plugin.
	    Make exists() also check for command modifiers, so that the
	    existence of ":lockmarks" can be checked for.
	    Also add ":keepmarks" to avoid that marks are deleted when
	    filtering text.
	    When deleting lines put marks 'A - 'Z and '0 - '9 at the first
	    deleted line instead of clearing the mark.  They were kept in the
	    viminfo file anyway.
	    Avoid that the gzip plugin puts deleted text in registers.
Files:	    runtime/doc/motion.txt, runtime/plugin/gzip.vim, src/ex_cmds.c,
	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/mark.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.191
Problem:    The intro message is outdated.  Information about sponsoring and

	    message now and then.  Add help file about sponsoring.
Files:	    runtime/doc/help.txt, runtime/doc/sponsor.txt, runtime/doc/tags,
	    runtime/menu.vim, src/version.c

Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.193
Problem:    When recalling a search pattern from the history from a ":s,a/c,"
	    command the '/' ends the search string. (JC van Winkel)
Solution:   Store the separator character with the history entries.  Escape
	    characters when needed, replace the old separator with the new one.
	    Also fixes that recalling a "/" search for a "?" command messes up
	    trailing flags.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/normal.c, src/proto/ex_getln.pro,
	    src/search.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.194 (after 6.2.068)
Problem:    For NetBeans, instead of writing the file and sending an event
	    about it, tell NetBeans to write the file.
Solution:   Add the "save" command, "netbeansBuffer" command and
	    "buttonRelease" event to the netbeans protocol.  Updated the
	    interface to version 2.2.  (Gordon Prieur)
	    Also: open a fold when the cursor has been positioned.
	    Also: fix memory leak, free result of nb_quote().

Solution:   Mark the messages to be translated.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.199 (after 6.2.194)
Problem:    Vim doesn't work perfectly well with NetBeans.
Solution:   When NetBeans saves the file, reset the timestamp to avoid "file
	    changed" warnings.  Close a buffer in a proper way.  Don't try
	    giving a debug message with an invalid pointer.  Send a
	    newDotAndMark message when needed.  Report a change by the "r"
	    command to NetBeans.  (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.200
Problem:    When recovering a file, 'fileformat' is always the default, thus
	    writing the file may result in differences. (Penelope Fudd)
Solution:   Before recovering the file try reading the original file to obtain
	    the values of 'fileformat', 'fileencoding', etc.
Files:	    src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.201
Problem:    When 'autowriteall' is set ":qall" still refuses to exit if there
	    is a modified buffer. (Antoine Mechelynck)
Solution:   Attempt writing modified buffers as intended.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.202
Problem:    Filetype names of CHILL and ch script are confusing.
Solution:   Rename "ch" to "chill" and "chscript" to "ch".
Files:	    runtime/filetype.vim, runtime/makemenu.vim, runtime/synmenu.vim
	    runtime/syntax/ch.vim, runtime/syntax/chill.vim

Patch 6.2.203
Problem:    With characterwise text that has more than one line, "3P" works
	    wrong.  "3p" has the same problem.  There also is a display
	    problem. (Daniel Goujot)
Solution:   Perform characterwise puts with a count in the right position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.204 (after 6.2.086)

Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.2.205 (extra)
Problem:    MS-Windows: When the taskbar is at the left or top of the screen,
	    the Vim window placement is wrong.
Solution:   Compute the size and position of the window correctly. (Taro
	    Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.206
Problem:    Multi-byte characters cannot be used as hotkeys in a console
	    dialog.  (Mattias Erkisson)
Solution:   Handle multibyte characters properly.  Also put () or [] around
	    default hotkeys.
Files:	    src/message.c, src/macros.h

Patch 6.2.207
Problem:    When 'encoding' is a multibyte encoding, expanding an
	    abbreviation that starts where insertion started results in
	    characters before the insertion to be deleted.  (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Stop searching leftwards for the start of the word at the position
	    where insertion started.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.208
Problem:    When using fold markers, three lines in a row have the start
	    marker and deleting the first one with "dd", a nested fold is not
	    deleted.  (Kamil Burzynski)
	    Using marker folding, a level 1 fold doesn't stop when it is
	    followed by "{{{2", starting a level 2 fold.
Solution:   Don't stop updating folds at the end of a change when the nesting
	    level of folds is larger than the fold level.
	    Correctly compute the number of folds that start at "{{{2".
	    Also avoid a crash for a NULL pointer.
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.209
Problem:    A bogus fold is created when using "P" while the cursor is in the
	    middle of a closed fold. (Kamil Burzynski)
Solution:   Correct the line number where marks are modified for closed folds.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.210 (extra)
Problem:    Mac OSX: antialiased fonts are not supported.

Patch 6.2.211 (extra)
Problem:    Code for handling file dropped on Vim is duplicated.
Solution:   Move the common code to gui_handle_drop().
	    Add code to drop the files in the window under the cursor.
	    Support drag&drop on the Macintosh.  (Taro Muraoka)
	    When dropping a directory name edit that directory (using the
	    explorer plugin)
	    Fix that changing directory with Shift pressed didn't work for
	    relative path names.

Solution:   Correctly compute the number of folds that start at "{{{1".
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.2.214 (after 6.2.211) (extra)
Problem:    Warning for an unused variable.
Solution:   Delete the declaration. (Bill McCarthy)
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.2.215
Problem:    NetBeans: problems saving an unmodified file.

Solution:   Don't try reading more input when a client-server command has been
	    received.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.221
Problem:    No file name completion for ":cscope add".
Solution:   Add the XFILE flag to ":cscope". (Gary Johnson)
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h

Patch 6.2.222
Problem:    Using "--remote" several times on a row only opens some of the
	    files. (Dany St-Amant)
Solution:   Don't delete all typeahead when the server receives a command from
	    a client, only delete typed characters.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.223
Problem:    Cscope: Avoid a hang when cscope waits for a response while Vim
	    waits for a prompt.
	    Error messages from Cscope mess up the display.
Solution:   Detect the hit-enter message and respond by sending a return
	    character to cscope. (Gary Johnson)
	    Use EMSG() and strerror() when possible.  Replace perror() with
	    PERROR() everywhere, add emsg3().

Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.226 (after 6.2.107) (extra)
Problem:    The "ws2-32.lib" file isn't always available.
Solution:   Use "WSock32.lib" instead. (Taro Muraoka, Dan Sharp)
Files:	    src/Make_cyg.mak, src/Make_ming.mak, src/Make_mvc.mak

Patch 6.2.227 (extra)
Problem:    The "PC" symbol is defined but not used anywhere.

	    src/Make_ming.mak

Patch 6.2.228
Problem:    Receiving CTRL-\ CTRL-N after typing "f" or "m" doesn't switch Vim
	    back to Normal mode.  Same for CTRL-\ CTRL-G.
Solution:   Check if the character typed after a command is CTRL-\ and obtain
	    another character to check for CTRL-N or CTRL-G, waiting up to
	    'ttimeoutlen' msec.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.229
Problem:    ":function" with a name that uses magic curlies does not work
	    inside a function.  (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Skip over the function name properly.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.230 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: a complex pattern may cause a crash.
Solution:   Use __try and __except to catch the exception and handle it
	    gracefully, when possible.  Add myresetstkoflw() to reset the
	    stack overflow. (Benjamin Peterson)

	    src/proto/os_win32.pro, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.231 (after 6.2.046)
Problem:    Various problems when an error exception is raised from within a
	    builtin function.  When it is invoked while evaluating arguments
	    to a function following arguments are still evaluated.  When
	    invoked with a line range it will be called for remaining lines.
Solution:   Update "force_abort" also after calling a builtin function, so
	    that aborting() always returns the correct value. (Servatius
	    Brandt)
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_eval.c, src/proto/ex_eval.pro,

Patch 6.2.232
Problem:    ":python vim.command('python print 2*2')" crashes Vim.  (Eugene
	    Minkovskii)
Solution:   Disallow executing a Python command recursively and give an error
	    message.
Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 6.2.233
Problem:    On Mac OSX adding -pthread for Python only generates a warning.
	    The test for Perl threads rejects Perl while it's OK.
	    Tcl doesn't work at all.
	    The test for Ruby fails if ruby exists but there are no header
	    files.  The Ruby library isn't detected properly
Solution:   Avoid adding -pthread on Mac OSX.  Accept Perl threads when it's
	    not the 5.5 threads.
	    Use the Tcl framework for header files.  For Ruby rename cWindow
	    to cVimWindow to avoid a name clash. (Ken Scott)
	    Only enable Ruby when the header files can be found.  Use "-lruby"
	    instead of "libruby.a" when it can't be found.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/if_ruby.c

Patch 6.2.234
Problem:    GTK 2 GUI: ":sp" and the ":q" leaves the cursor on the command

	    owned by NetBeans.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.237
Problem:    GTK 2: Thai text is drawn wrong.  It changes when moving the
	    cursor over it.
Solution:   Disable the shaping engine, it moves combining characters to a
	    wrong position and combines characters, while drawing the cursor
	    doesn't combine characters.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.238 (after 6.2.231)
Problem:    ":function" does not work inside a while loop. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Add get_while_line() and pass it to do_one_cmd() when in a while
	    loop, so that all lines are stored and can be used again when
	    repeating the loop.
	    Adjust test 49 so that it checks for the fixed problems.
	    (Servatius Brandt)

Problem:    GTK 2: Searching for bitmaps for the toolbar doesn't work as with
	    other systems.  Need to explicitly use "icon=name".  (Ned Konz,
	    Christian J.  Robinson)
Solution:   Search for icons like done for Motif.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.241
Problem:    GTK 2: Search and Search/Replace dialogs are synced, that makes no
	    sense.  Buttons are sometimes greyed-out. (Jeremy Messenger)
Solution:   Remove the code to sync the two dialogs.  Adjust the code to react
	    to an empty search string to also work for GTK2. (David Necas)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.242
Problem:    Gnome: "vim --help" only shows the Gnome arguments, not the Vim
	    arguments.

Patch 6.2.244
Problem:    ':echo "\xf7"' displays the illegal byte as if it was a character
	    and leaves "cho" after it.
Solution:   When checking the length of a UTF-8 byte sequence and it's shorter
	    than the number of bytes available, assume it's an illegal byte.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.245

Patch 6.2.251
Problem:    GTK: The 'v' flag in 'guioptions' doesn't work. (Steve Hall)
	    Order of buttons is reversed for GTK 2.2.4.  Don't always get
	    focus back after handling a dialog.
Solution:   Make buttons appear vertically when desired.  Reverse the order in
	    which buttons are added to a dialog.  Move mouse pointer around
	    when the dialog is done and we don't have focus.

Patch 6.2.259
Problem:    If there are messages when exiting, on the console there is a
	    hit-enter prompt while the message can be read; in the GUI the
	    message may not be visible.
Solution:   Use the hit-enter prompt when there is an error message from
	    writing the viminfo file or autocommands, or when there is any
	    output in the GUI and 'verbose' is set.  Don't use a hit-enter
	    prompt for the non-GUI version unless there is an error message.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.260
Problem:    GTK 2: Can't quit a dialog with <Esc>.
	    GTK 1 and 2: <Enter> always gives a result, even when the default
	    button has been disabled.
Solution:   Handle these keys explicitly.  When no default button is specified
	    use the first one (works mostly like it was before).
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 6.2.261
Problem:    When 'autoindent' and 'cindent' are set and a line is recognized
	    as a comment, starting a new line won't do 'cindent' formatting.
Solution:   Also use 'cindent' formatting for lines that are used as a
	    comment. (Servatius Brandt)
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.262
Problem:    1 CTRL-W w beeps, even though going to the first window is
	    possible. (Charles Campbell)
Solution:   Don't beep.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.263
Problem:    Lint warnings: Duplicate function prototypes, duplicate macros,
	    use of a zero character instead of a zero pointer, unused
	    variable.  Clearing allocated memory in a complicated way.
Solution:   Remove the function prototypes from farsi.h.  Remove the
	    duplicated lines in keymap.h.  Change getvcol() argument from NUL
	    to NULL.  Remove the "col" variable in regmatch().  Use
	    lalloc_clear() instead of lalloc(). (Walter Briscoe)
Files:	    src/farsi.h, src/keymap.h, src/ops.c, src/regexp.c, src/search.c

Patch 6.2.264 (after 6.2.247)

	    can't be changed from a modeline.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h, src/options.c

Patch 6.2.266
Problem:    When redirecting output and using ":silent", line breaks are
	    missing from output of ":map" and ":tselect".  Alignment of
	    columns is wrong.
Solution:   Insert a line break where "msg_didout" was tested.  Update msg_col
	    when redirecting and using ":silent".
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/message.c

Patch 6.2.267 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: "&&" in a tearoff menu is not shown. (Luc Hermitte)

Patch 6.2.268
Problem:    GUI: When changing 'guioptions' part of the window may be off

	    when adding something.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.269
Problem:    Diff mode does not highlight a change in a combining character.
	    (Raphael Finkel)

	    a character that contains a change.
Files:	    src/diff.c

Patch 6.2.270
Problem:    Completion in Insert mode, then repeating with ".", doesn't handle

	    redo buffer.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.271
Problem:    NetBeans: Can't do "tail -f" on the log.  Passing socket info with
	    an argument or environment variable is not secure.

	    through a file. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    runtime/doc/netbeans.txt, src/main.c, src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.272
Problem:    When the "po" directory exists, but "po/Makefile" doesn't,
	    building fails.  Make loops when the "po" directory has been
	    deleted after running configure.
Solution:   Check for the "po/Makefile" instead of just the "po" directory.
	    Check this again before trying to run make with that Makefile.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.273
Problem:    Changing the sort order in an explorer window for an empty
	    directory produces error messages. (Doug Kearns)
Solution:   When an invalid range is used for a function that is not going to
	    be executed, skip over the arguments anyway.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.274
Problem:    ":print" skips empty lines when 'list' is set and there is no
	    "eol" in 'listchars'. (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   Skip outputting a space for an empty line only when 'list' is set
	    and the end-of-line character is not empty.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.275 (extra, after 6.2.267)

Patch 6.2.280
Problem:    "do" and ":diffget" don't work in the first line and the last line
	    of a buffer. (Aron Griffis)

Patch 6.2.282
Problem:    When using CTRL-O to go back to a help file, it becomes listed.
	    (Andrew Nesbit)
	    Using ":tag" or ":tjump" in a help file doesn't keep the help file
	    settings (e.g. for 'iskeyword').
Solution:   Don't mark a buffer as listed when its help flag is set.  Put all
	    the option settings for a help buffer together in do_ecmd().
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.283
Problem:    The "local additions" in help.txt are used without conversion,
	    causing latin1 characters showing up wrong when 'enc' is utf-8.
	    (Antoine J. Mechelynck)
Solution:   Convert the text to 'encoding'.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.284
Problem:    Listing a function puts "endfunction" in the message history.
	    Typing "q" at the more prompt isn't handled correctly when listing
	    variables and functions.  (Hara Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Don't use msg() for "endfunction".  Check "got_int" regularly.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.285
Problem:    GUI: In a single wrapped line that fills the window, "gj" in the
	    last screen line leaves the cursor behind. (Ivan Tarasov)
Solution:   Undraw the cursor before scrolling the text up.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.286
Problem:    When trying to rename a file and it doesn't exist, the destination
	    file is deleted anyway. (Luc Deux)

	    Muraoka)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.287 (after 6.2.264)

Patch 6.2.295
Problem:    When in debug mode, receiving a message from a remote client
	    causes a crash.  Evaluating an expression causes Vim to wait for
	    "cont" to be typed, without a prompt.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Disable debugging when evaluating an expression for a client.
	    (Michael Geddes)  Don't try reading into the typeahead buffer when
	    it may have been filled in another way.

	    Python recursively. (Matthew Mueller)
Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 6.2.298
Problem:    A change always sets the '. mark and an insert always sets the '^
	    mark, even when this is not wanted.
	    Cannot go back to the position of older changes without undoing
	    those changes.
Solution:   Add the ":keepjumps" command modifier.
	    Add the "g," and "g;" commands.

Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.2.302
Problem:    Using "CTRL-O ." in Insert mode doesn't work properly. (Benji
	    Fisher)
Solution:   Restore "restart_edit" after an insert command that was not typed.
	    Avoid waiting with displaying the mode when there is no text to be
	    overwritten.
	    Fix that "CTRL-O ." sometimes doesn't put the cursor back after
	    the end-of-line.  Only reset the flag that CTRL-O was used past
	    the end of the line when restarting editing.  Update "o_lnum"
	    number when inserting text and "o_eol" is set.
Files:	    src/edit.c, src/normal.c

Solution:   Sync undo before changing 'undolevels'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.311 (after 6.2.298)
Problem:    When making several changes in one line the changelist grows
	    quickly.  There is no error message for reaching the end of the
	    changelist.  Reading changelist marks from viminfo doesn't work
	    properly.
Solution:   Only make a new entry in the changelist when making a change in
	    another line or 'textwidth' columns away.  Add E662, E663 and E664
	    error messages.  Put a changelist mark from viminfo one position
	    before the end.

Problem:    When formatting text all marks in the formatted lines are lost.
	    A word is not joined to a previous line when this would be
	    possible.  (Mikolaj Machowski)
Solution:   Try to keep marks in the same position as much as possible.
	    Also keep mark positions when joining lines.
	    Start auto-formatting in the previous line when appropriate.
	    Add the "gw" operator: Like "gq" but keep the cursor where it is.
