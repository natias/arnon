Upgrading or downgrading an existing local repository
-----------------------------------------------------

The `debugupgrade` command does various upgrades or downgrades
on a local repository
based on the current Mercurial version and on configuration.
The same `format.use-dirstate-v2` configuration is used again.

Example to upgrade::

    $ hg debugupgrade --config format.use-dirstate-v2=1

Example to downgrade to `dirstate-v1`::

    $ hg debugupgrade --config format.use-dirstate-v2=0

Both of this commands do nothing but print a list of proposed changes,
which may include changes unrelated to the dirstate.
Those other changes are controlled by their own configuration keys.
Add `--run` to a command to actually apply the proposed changes.

Backups of `.hg/requires` and `.hg/dirstate` are created
in a `.hg/upgradebackup.*` directory.
If something goes wrong, restoring those files should undo the change.

Note that upgrading affects compatibility with older versions of Mercurial
as noted above.
This can be relevant when a repository’s files are on a USB drive
or some other removable media, or shared over the network, etc.

Internal filesystem representation
==================================

Requirements file
-----------------

The `.hg/requires` file indicates which of various optional file formats
are used by a given repository.
Mercurial aborts when seeing a requirement it does not know about,
which avoids older version accidentally messing up a repository
that uses a format that was introduced later.
For versions that do support a format, the presence or absence of
the corresponding requirement indicates whether to use that format.

When the file contains a `dirstate-v2` line,
the `dirstate-v2` format is used.
With no such line `dirstate-v1` is used.

High level description
----------------------

Whereas `dirstate-v1` uses a single `.hg/dirstate` file,
in `dirstate-v2` that file is a "docket" file
that only contains some metadata
and points to separate data file named `.hg/dirstate.{ID}`,
where `{ID}` is a random identifier.

This separation allows making data files append-only
and therefore safer to memory-map.
Creating a new data file (occasionally to clean up unused data)
can be done with a different ID
without disrupting another Mercurial process
that could still be using the previous data file.

Both files have a format designed to reduce the need for parsing,
by using fixed-size binary components as much as possible.
For data that is not fixed-size,
references to other parts of a file can be made by storing "pseudo-pointers":
integers counted in bytes from the start of a file.
For read-only access no data structure is needed,
only a bytes buffer (possibly memory-mapped directly from the filesystem)
with specific parts read on demand.

The data file contains "nodes" organized in a tree.
Each node represents a file or directory inside the working directory
or its parent changeset.
This tree has the same structure as the filesystem,
so a node representing a directory has child nodes representing
the files and subdirectories contained directly in that directory.

The docket file format
----------------------

This is implemented in `rust/hg-core/src/dirstate_tree/on_disk.rs`
and `mercurial/dirstateutils/docket.py`.

Components of the docket file are found at fixed offsets,
counted in bytes from the start of the file:

* Offset 0:
  The 12-bytes marker string "dirstate-v2\n" ending with a newline character.
  This makes it easier to tell a dirstate-v2 file from a dirstate-v1 file,
  although it is not strictly necessary
  since `.hg/requires` determines which format to use.

* Offset 12:
  The changeset node ID on the first parent of the working directory,
  as up to 32 binary bytes.
  If a node ID is shorter (20 bytes for SHA-1),
  it is start-aligned and the rest of the bytes are set to zero.

* Offset 44:
  The changeset node ID on the second parent of the working directory,
  or all zeros if there isn’t one.
  Also 32 binary bytes.

* Offset 76:
  Tree metadata on 44 bytes, described below.
  Its separation in this documentation from the rest of the docket
  reflects a detail of the current implementation.
  Since tree metadata is also made of fields at fixed offsets, those could
  be inlined here by adding 76 bytes to each offset.

* Offset 120:
  The used size of the data file, as a 32-bit big-endian integer.
  The actual size of the data file may be larger
  (if another Mercurial process is appending to it
  but has not updated the docket yet).
  That extra data must be ignored.

* Offset 124:
  The length of the data file identifier, as a 8-bit integer.

* Offset 125:
  The data file identifier.

* Any additional data is current ignored, and dropped when updating the file.

Tree metadata in the docket file
--------------------------------

Tree metadata is similarly made of components at fixed offsets.
These offsets are counted in bytes from the start of tree metadata,
which is 76 bytes after the start of the docket file.

This metadata can be thought of as the singular root of the tree
formed by nodes in the data file.

* Offset 0:
  Pseudo-pointer to the start of root nodes,
  counted in bytes from the start of the data file,
  as a 32-bit big-endian integer.
  These nodes describe files and directories found directly
  at the root of the working directory.

* Offset 4:
  Number of root nodes, as a 32-bit big-endian integer.

* Offset 8:
  Total number of nodes in the entire tree that "have a dirstate entry",
  as a 32-bit big-endian integer.
  Those nodes represent files that would be present at all in `dirstate-v1`.
  This is typically less than the total number of nodes.
  This counter is used to implement `len(dirstatemap)`.

* Offset 12:
  Number of nodes in the entire tree that have a copy source,
  as a 32-bit big-endian integer.
  At the next commit, these files are recorded
  as having been copied or moved/renamed from that source.
  (A move is recorded as a copy and separate removal of the source.)
  This counter is used to implement `len(dirstatemap.copymap)`.

* Offset 16:
  An estimation of how many bytes of the data file
  (within its used size) are unused, as a 32-bit big-endian integer.
  When appending to an existing data file,
  some existing nodes or paths can be unreachable from the new root
  but they still take up space.
  This counter is used to decide when to write a new data file from scratch
  instead of appending to an existing one,
  in order to get rid of that unreachable data
  and avoid unbounded file size growth.

* Offset 20:
  These four bytes are currently ignored
  and reset to zero when updating a docket file.
  This is an attempt at forward compatibility:
  future Mercurial versions could use this as a bit field
  to indicate that a dirstate has additional data or constraints.
  Finding a dirstate file with the relevant bit unset indicates that
  it was written by a then-older version
  which is not aware of that future change.

* Offset 24:
  Either 20 zero bytes, or a SHA-1 hash as 20 binary bytes.
  When present, the hash is of ignore patterns
  that were used for some previous run of the `status` algorithm.

* (Offset 44: end of tree metadata)

Optional hash of ignore patterns
--------------------------------

The implementation of `status` at `rust/hg-core/src/dirstate_tree/status.rs`
has been optimized such that its run time is dominated by calls
to `stat` for reading the filesystem metadata of a file or directory,
and to `readdir` for listing the contents of a directory.
In some cases the algorithm can skip calls to `readdir`
(saving significant time)
because the dirstate already contains enough of the relevant information
to build the correct `status` results.

The default configuration of `hg status` is to list unknown files
but not ignored files.
In this case, it matters for the `readdir`-skipping optimization
if a given file used to be ignored but became unknown
because `.hgignore` changed.
To detect the possibility of such a change,
the tree metadata contains an optional hash of all ignore patterns.

We define:

* "Root" ignore files as:

  - `.hgignore` at the root of the repository if it exists
  - And all files from `ui.ignore.*` config.

  This set of files is sorted by the string representation of their path.

* The "expanded contents" of an ignore files is the byte string made
  by the concatenation of its contents followed by the "expanded contents"
  of other files included with `include:` or `subinclude:` directives,
  in inclusion order. This definition is recursive, as included files can
  themselves include more files.

* "filepath" as the bytes of the ignore file path
  relative to the root of the repository if inside the repository,
  or the untouched path as defined in the configuration.

This hash is defined as the SHA-1 of the following line format:

<filepath> <sha1 of the "expanded contents">\n

for each "root" ignore file. (in sorted order)

(Note that computing this does not require actually concatenating
into a single contiguous byte sequence.
Instead a SHA-1 hasher object can be created
and fed separate chunks one by one.)

The data file format
--------------------

This is implemented in `rust/hg-core/src/dirstate_tree/on_disk.rs`
and `mercurial/dirstateutils/v2.py`.

The data file contains two types of data: paths and nodes.

Paths and nodes can be organized in any order in the file, except that sibling
nodes must be next to each other and sorted by their path.
Contiguity lets the parent refer to them all
by their count and a single pseudo-pointer,
instead of storing one pseudo-pointer per child node.
Sorting allows using binary search to find a child node with a given name
in `O(log(n))` byte sequence comparisons.

The current implementation writes paths and child node before a given node
for ease of figuring out the value of pseudo-pointers by the time the are to be
written, but this is not an obligation and readers must not rely on it.

A path is stored as a byte string anywhere in the file, without delimiter.
It is referred to by one or more node by a pseudo-pointer to its start, and its
length in bytes. Since there is no delimiter,
when a path is a substring of another the same bytes could be reused,
although the implementation does not exploit this as of this writing.

A node is stored on 43 bytes with components at fixed offsets. Paths and
child nodes relevant to a node are stored externally and referenced though
pseudo-pointers.

All integers are stored in big-endian. All pseudo-pointers are 32-bit integers
counting bytes from the start of the data file. Path lengths and positions
are 16-bit integers, also counted in bytes.

Node components are:

* Offset 0:
  Pseudo-pointer to the full path of this node,
  from the working directory root.

* Offset 4:
  Length of the full path.

* Offset 6:
  Position of the last `/` path separator within the full path,
  in bytes from the start of the full path,
  or zero if there isn’t one.
  The part of the full path after this position is the "base name".
  Since sibling nodes have the same parent, only their base name vary
  and needs to be considered when doing binary search to find a given path.

* Offset 8:
  Pseudo-pointer to the "copy source" path for this node,
  or zero if there is no copy source.

* Offset 12:
  Length of the copy source path, or zero if there isn’t one.

* Offset 14:
  Pseudo-pointer to the start of child nodes.

* Offset 18:
  Number of child nodes, as a 32-bit integer.
  They occupy 43 times this number of bytes
  (not counting space for paths, and further descendants).

* Offset 22:
  Number as a 32-bit integer of descendant nodes in this subtree,
  not including this node itself,
  that "have a dirstate entry".
  Those nodes represent files that would be present at all in `dirstate-v1`.
  This is typically less than the total number of descendants.
  This counter is used to implement `has_dir`.

* Offset 26:
  Number as a 32-bit integer of descendant nodes in this subtree,
  not including this node itself,
  that represent files tracked in the working directory.
  (For example, `hg rm` makes a file untracked.)
  This counter is used to implement `has_tracked_dir`.

* Offset 30:
  A `flags` fields  that packs some boolean values as bits of a 16-bit integer.
  Starting from least-significant, bit masks are::

    WDIR_TRACKED = 1 << 0
    P1_TRACKED = 1 << 1
    P2_INFO = 1 << 2
    MODE_EXEC_PERM = 1 << 3
    MODE_IS_SYMLINK = 1 << 4
    HAS_FALLBACK_EXEC = 1 << 5
    FALLBACK_EXEC = 1 << 6
    HAS_FALLBACK_SYMLINK = 1 << 7
    FALLBACK_SYMLINK = 1 << 8
    EXPECTED_STATE_IS_MODIFIED = 1 << 9
    HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE = 1 << 10
    HAS_MTIME = 1 << 11
    MTIME_SECOND_AMBIGUOUS = 1 << 12
    DIRECTORY = 1 << 13
    ALL_UNKNOWN_RECORDED = 1 << 14
    ALL_IGNORED_RECORDED = 1 << 15

  The meaning of each bit is described below.

  Other bits are unset.
  They may be assigned meaning if the future,
  with the limitation that Mercurial versions that pre-date such meaning
  will always reset those bits to unset when writing nodes.
  (A new node is written for any mutation in its subtree,
  leaving the bytes of the old node unreachable
  until the data file is rewritten entirely.)

* Offset 32:
  A `size` field described below, as a 32-bit integer.
  Unlike in dirstate-v1, negative values are not used.

* Offset 36:
  The seconds component of an `mtime` field described below,
  as a 32-bit integer.
  Unlike in dirstate-v1, negative values are not used.
  When `mtime` is used, this is number of seconds since the Unix epoch
  truncated to its lower 31 bits.

* Offset 40:
  The nanoseconds component of an `mtime` field described below,
  as a 32-bit integer.
  When `mtime` is used,
  this is the number of nanoseconds since `mtime.seconds`,
  always strictly less than one billion.

  This may be zero if more precision is not available.
  (This can happen because of limitations in any of Mercurial, Python,
  libc, the operating system, …)

  When comparing two mtimes and either has this component set to zero,
  the sub-second precision of both should be ignored.
  False positives when checking mtime equality due to clock resolution
  are always possible and the status algorithm needs to deal with them,
  but having too many false negatives could be harmful too.

* (Offset 44: end of this node)

The meaning of the boolean values packed in `flags` is:

`WDIR_TRACKED`
    Set if the working directory contains a tracked file at this node’s path.
    This is typically set and unset by `hg add` and `hg rm`.

`P1_TRACKED`
    Set if the working directory’s first parent changeset
    (whose node identifier is found in tree metadata)
    contains a tracked file at this node’s path.
    This is a cache to reduce manifest lookups.

`P2_INFO`
    Set if the file has been involved in some merge operation.
    Either because it was actually merged,
    or because the version in the second parent p2 version was ahead,
    or because some rename moved it there.
    In either case `hg status` will want it displayed as modified.

Files that would be mentioned at all in the `dirstate-v1` file format
have a node with at least one of the above three bits set in `dirstate-v2`.
Let’s call these files "tracked anywhere",
and "untracked" the nodes with all three of these bits unset.
Untracked nodes are typically for directories:
they hold child nodes and form the tree structure.
Additional untracked nodes may also exist.
Although implementations should strive to clean up nodes
that are entirely unused, other untracked nodes may also exist.
For example, a future version of Mercurial might in some cases
add nodes for untracked files or/and ignored files in the working directory
in order to optimize `hg status`
by enabling it to skip `readdir` in more cases.

`HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE`
    Must be unset for untracked nodes.
    For files tracked anywhere, if this is set:
    - The `size` field is the expected file size,
      in bytes truncated its lower to 31 bits.
    - The expected execute permission for the file’s owner
      is given by `MODE_EXEC_PERM`
    - The expected file type is given by `MODE_IS_SIMLINK`:
      a symbolic link if set, or a normal file if unset.
    If this is unset the expected size, permission, and file type are unknown.
    The `size` field is unused (set to zero).

`HAS_MTIME`
    The nodes contains a "valid" last modification time in the `mtime` field.


    It means the `mtime` was already strictly in the past when observed,
    meaning that later changes cannot happen in the same clock tick
    and must cause a different modification time
    (unless the system clock jumps back and we get unlucky,
    which is not impossible but deemed unlikely enough).

    This means that if `std::fs::symlink_metadata` later reports
    the same modification time
    and ignored patterns haven’t changed,
    we can assume the node to be unchanged on disk.

    The `mtime` field can then be used to skip more expensive lookup when
    checking the status of "tracked" nodes.

    It can also be set for node where `DIRECTORY` is set.
    See `DIRECTORY` documentation for details.

`DIRECTORY`
    When set, this entry will match a directory that exists or existed on the
    file system.

    * When `HAS_MTIME` is set a directory has been seen on the file system and
      `mtime` matches its last modification time. However, `HAS_MTIME` not
      being set does not indicate the lack of directory on the file system.

    * When not tracked anywhere, this node does not represent an ignored or
      unknown file on disk.

    If `HAS_MTIME` is set
    and `mtime` matches the last modification time of the directory on disk,
    the directory is unchanged
    and we can skip calling `std::fs::read_dir` again for this directory,
    and iterate child dirstate nodes instead.
    (as long as `ALL_UNKNOWN_RECORDED` and `ALL_IGNORED_RECORDED` are taken
    into account)

`MODE_EXEC_PERM`
    Must be unset if `HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE` is unset.
    If `HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE` is set,
    this indicates whether the file’s own is expected
    to have execute permission.

    Beware that on system without fs support for this information, the value
    stored in the dirstate might be wrong and should not be relied on.

`MODE_IS_SYMLINK`
    Must be unset if `HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE` is unset.
    If `HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE` is set,
    this indicates whether the file is expected to be a symlink
    as opposed to a normal file.

    Beware that on system without fs support for this information, the value
    stored in the dirstate might be wrong and should not be relied on.

`EXPECTED_STATE_IS_MODIFIED`
    Must be unset for untracked nodes.
    For:
    - a file tracked anywhere
    - that has expected metadata (`HAS_MODE_AND_SIZE` and `HAS_MTIME`)
    - if that metadata matches
      metadata found in the working directory with `stat`
    This bit indicates the status of the file.
    If set, the status is modified. If unset, it is clean.

    In cases where `hg status` needs to read the contents of a file
    because metadata is ambiguous, this bit lets it record the result
    if the result is modified so that a future run of `hg status`
    does not need to do the same again.
    It is valid to never set this bit,
    and consider expected metadata ambiguous if it is set.

`ALL_UNKNOWN_RECORDED`
    If set, all "unknown" children existing on disk (at the time of the last
    status) have been recorded and the `mtime` associated with
    `DIRECTORY` can be used for optimization even when "unknown" file
    are listed.

    Note that the amount recorded "unknown" children can still be zero if None
    where present.

    Also note that having this flag unset does not imply that no "unknown"
    children have been recorded. Some might be present, but there is
    no guarantee that is will be all of them.

`ALL_IGNORED_RECORDED`
    If set, all "ignored" children existing on disk (at the time of the last
    status) have been recorded and the `mtime` associated with
    `DIRECTORY` can be used for optimization even when "ignored" file
    are listed.

    Note that the amount recorded "ignored" children can still be zero if None
    where present.

    Also note that having this flag unset does not imply that no "ignored"
    children have been recorded. Some might be present, but there is
    no guarantee that is will be all of them.

`HAS_FALLBACK_EXEC`
    If this flag is set, the entry carries "fallback" information for the
    executable bit in the `FALLBACK_EXEC` flag.

    Fallback information can be stored in the dirstate to keep track of
    filesystem attribute tracked by Mercurial when the underlying file
    system or operating system does not support that property, (e.g.
    Windows).

`FALLBACK_EXEC`
    Should be ignored if `HAS_FALLBACK_EXEC` is unset. If set the file for this
    entry should be considered executable if that information cannot be
    extracted from the file system. If unset it should be considered
    non-executable instead.

`HAS_FALLBACK_SYMLINK`
    If this flag is set, the entry carries "fallback" information for symbolic
    link status in the `FALLBACK_SYMLINK` flag.

    Fallback information can be stored in the dirstate to keep track of
    filesystem attribute tracked by Mercurial when the underlying file
    system or operating system does not support that property, (e.g.
    Windows).

`FALLBACK_SYMLINK`
    Should be ignored if `HAS_FALLBACK_SYMLINK` is unset. If set the file for
    this entry should be considered a symlink if that information cannot be
    extracted from the file system. If unset it should be considered a normal
    file instead.

`MTIME_SECOND_AMBIGUOUS`
    This flag is relevant only when `HAS_FILE_MTIME` is set.  When set, the
    `mtime` stored in the entry is only valid for comparison with timestamps
    that have nanosecond information. If available timestamp does not carries
    nanosecond information, the `mtime` should be ignored and no optimization
    can be applied.

the main hg command line as if they were built-in commands. The extensions
have full access to the *internal* API.

Use of Mercurial's internal API very likely makes your code subject to
Mercurial's license. Before going any further, read the License page.

There are NO guarantees that third-party code calling into Mercurial's

File Layout
===========

Extensions are usually written as simple python modules. Larger ones are
better split into multiple modules of a single package (see the convert
extension). The package root module gives its name to the extension and
implements the ``cmdtable`` and optional callbacks described below.

Command table
=============

To write your own extension, your python module can provide an optional dict
named ``cmdtable`` with entries describing each command. A command should be
registered to the ``cmdtable`` by ``@command`` decorator. All string-like
values must be the ``bytes`` type, and are thus prefixed with ``b``.

Example using ``@command`` decorator (requires Mercurial 1.9)::

    from mercurial.i18n import _

    cmdtable = {}
    try:
        from mercurial import registrar
        command = registrar.command(cmdtable)
    except (AttributeError, ImportError):
        # Fallback to hg < 4.3 support
        from mercurial import cmdutil
        command = cmdutil.command(cmdtable)

    @command(b'print-parents',
        [(b's', b'short', None, _(b'print short form')),
         (b'l', b'long', None, _(b'print long form'))],
        _(b'[options] node'))
    def printparents(ui, repo, node, **opts):
        ...

The cmdtable dictionary
-----------------------

The ``cmdtable`` dictionary uses as key the new command names, and, as value,
a tuple containing:

1. the function to be called when the command is used.
2. a list of options the command can take.
3. a command line synopsis for the command (the function docstring is used for
   the full help).

List of options
---------------

All the command flag options are documented in the mercurial/fancyopts.py
sources.

The options list is a list of tuples containing:

1. the short option letter, or ``''`` if no short option is available
   (for example, ``o`` for a ``-o`` option).
2. the long option name (for example, ``option`` for a ``--option`` option).
3. a default value for the option.
4. a help string for the option (it's possible to omit the "hg newcommand"
   part and only the options and parameter substring is needed).

Command function signatures
---------------------------

Functions that implement new commands always receive a ``ui`` and usually
a ``repo`` parameter. The rest of parameters are taken from the command line
items that don't start with a dash and are passed in the same order they were
written. If no default value is given in the parameter list they are required.

If there is no repo to be associated with the command and consequently no
``repo`` passed, then ``norepo=True`` should be passed to the ``@command``
decorator::

    @command(b'mycommand', [], norepo=True)
    def mycommand(ui, **opts):
        ...

For examples of ``norepo``, see the convert extension.

Command function docstrings
===========================

The docstring of your function is used as the main help text, shown by
``hg help mycommand``. The docstring should be formatted using a simple
subset of reStructuredText markup. The supported constructs include:

Paragraphs::

    This is a paragraph.

    Paragraphs are separated

A verbatim block is introduced with a double colon followed by an indented
block. The double colon is turned into a single colon on display::

    Some text::

      verbatim
        text
         !!

We have field lists::

    :key1: value1
    :key2: value2

Bullet lists::

    - foo
    - bar

Enumerated lists::

    1. foo
    2. bar

Inline markup::

    ``*bold*``, ``monospace``, :hg:`command`

Mark Mercurial commands with ``:hg:`` to make a nice link to the corresponding
documentation. We'll expand the support if new constructs can be parsed
without too much trouble.

Communicating with the user
===========================

Besides the ``ui`` methods, like ``ui.write(*msg)`` or
``ui.prompt(msg, default=b"y")``, an extension can add help text for each
of its commands and the extension itself.

The module docstring will be used as help string when ``hg help extensionname``
is used and, similarly, the help string for a command and the docstring
belonging to the function that's wrapped by the command will be shown when
``hg help command`` is invoked.

Setup Callbacks
===============

Extensions are loaded in phases. All extensions are processed in a given phase
before the next phase begins. In the first phase, all extension modules are
loaded and registered with Mercurial. This means that you can find all enabled
extensions with ``extensions.find`` in the following phases.

Extension setup
---------------

There are two callbacks to be called when extensions are loaded, named
``uisetup`` and ``extsetup``. ``uisetup`` is called first for each extension,
then ``extsetup`` is called. This means ``extsetup`` can be useful in case
one extension optionally depends on another extension.

Both ``uisetup`` and ``extsetup`` receive a ui object with the local
repository configuration::

    def uisetup(ui):
        # ...

    def extsetup(ui):
        # ...

Be aware that ``uisetup`` in NOT the function to configure a ``ui`` instance.
It's called only once per process, not per ``ui`` instance. Also, any changes
to the ``ui`` may be discarded because the ``ui`` here is a temporarily loaded
local configuration. So, it's generally wrong to do `ui.setconfig()` in
these callbacks. Notable exception is setting ``pre/post-<command>`` hooks
and extending ``ui.__class__``.

In Mercurial 1.3.1 or earlier, ``extsetup`` takes no argument.

Command table setup
-------------------

After ``extsetup``, the ``cmdtable`` is copied into the global command table
in Mercurial.

Ui instance setup
-----------------

The optional ``uipopulate`` is called for each ``ui`` instance after
configuration is loaded, where extensions can set up additional ui members,
update configuration by ``ui.setconfig()``, and extend the class dynamically.

Typically there are three ``ui`` instances involved in command execution:

``req.ui`` (or ``repo.baseui``)
    Only system and user configurations are loaded into it.
``lui``
    Local repository configuration is loaded as well. This will be used at
    early dispatching stage where a repository isn't available.
``repo.ui``
    The fully-loaded ``ui`` used after a repository is instantiated. This
    will be created from the ``req.ui`` per repository.

In command server and hgweb, this may be called more than once for the same
``ui`` instance.

(New in Mercurial 4.9)

Repository setup
----------------

Extensions can implement an optional callback named ``reposetup``. It is
called after the main Mercurial repository initialization, and can be used
to setup any local state the extension might need.

As other command functions it receives an ``ui`` object and a ``repo`` object
(no additional parameters for this, though)::

    def reposetup(ui, repo):
        #do initialization here.

It is important to take into account that the ``ui`` object that is received
by the ``reposetup`` function is not the same as the one received by the
``uisetup`` and ``extsetup`` functions. This is particularly important when
setting up hooks as described in the following section, since not all hooks
use the same ``ui`` object and hence different hooks must be configured in
different setup functions.

Wrapping methods on the ui and repo classes
-------------------------------------------

Because extensions can be loaded *per repository*, you should avoid using
``extensions.wrapfunction()`` on methods of the ``ui`` and ``repo`` objects.
Instead, create a subclass of the specific class of the instance passed into
the ``*setup()`` hook; e.g. use ``ui.__class__`` as the base class, then
reassign your new class to ``ui.__class__`` again. Mercurial will then use
your updated ``ui`` or ``repo`` instance only for repositories where your
extension is enabled (or copies thereof, reusing your new class).

For example::

    def uisetup(ui):
        class echologui(ui.__class__):
            def log(self, service, *msg, **opts):
                if msg:
                    self.write(b'%s: %s\n' % (service, msg[0] % msg[1:]))
                super(echologui, self).log(service, *msg, **opts)

        ui.__class__ = echologui

Configuring Hooks
=================

Some extensions must use hooks to do their work. These required hooks can
be configured manually by the user by modifying the ``[hook]`` section of
their hgrc, but they can also be configured automatically by calling the
``ui.setconfig(b'hooks', ...)`` function in one of the setup functions
described above.

The main difference between manually modifying the hooks section in the hgrc
and using ``ui.setconfig()`` is that when using ``ui.setconfig()`` you have
access to the actual hook function object, which you can pass directly to
``ui.setconfig()``, while when you use the hooks section of the hgrc file
you must refer to the hook function by using the
``python:modulename.functioname`` idiom (e.g. ``python:hgext.notify.hook``).

For example::

    # Define hooks -- note that the actual function name it irrelevant.
    def preupdatehook(ui, repo, **kwargs):
        ui.write(b"Pre-update hook triggered\n")

    def updatehook(ui, repo, **kwargs):
        ui.write(b"Update hook triggered\n")

    def uisetup(ui):
        # When pre-<cmd> and post-<cmd> hooks are configured by means of
        # the ui.setconfig() function, you must use the ui object passed
        # to uisetup or extsetup.
        ui.setconfig(b"hooks", b"pre-update.myextension", preupdatehook)

    def reposetup(ui, repo):
        # Repository-specific hooks can be configured here. These include
        # the update hook.
        ui.setconfig(b"hooks", b"update.myextension", updatehook)

Note how different hooks may need to be configured in different setup
functions. In the example you can see that the ``update`` hook must be
configured in the ``reposetup`` function, while the ``pre-update`` hook
must be configured on the ``uisetup`` or the ``extsetup`` functions.

Marking compatible versions
===========================

Every extension should use the ``testedwith`` variable to specify Mercurial
releases it's known to be compatible with. This helps us and users diagnose
where problems are coming from::

    testedwith = b'2.0 2.0.1 2.1 2.1.1 2.1.2'

Do not use the ``internal`` marker in third-party extensions; we will
immediately drop all bug reports mentioning your extension if we catch you
doing this.

Similarly, an extension can use the ``buglink`` variable to specify how users
should report issues with the extension.  This link will be included in the
error message if the extension produces errors::

    buglink = b'https://bitbucket.org/USER/REPO/issues'

If an extension requires a minimum version of Mercurial, it can be declared
with the ``minimumhgversion`` variable::

    minimumhgversion = b'4.6'

Older clients will print a warning that the extension requires a new version,
instead of attempting to load it.

The extension itself can be assigned a version value through one of two module
attributes, and will be displayed in crash reports and  :hg:`version -v`::

  * ``__version__`` is a plain value
  * ``getversion`` is a no argument ``Callable`` that returns a value

In both cases, the value must be either a byte string, or a list or tuple of
numeric values which will be joined with ``.``.

Wrap up: what belongs where?
============================

You will find here a list of most common tasks, based on setups from the
extensions included in Mercurial core.

uisetup
-------

* Changes to ``ui.__class__`` . The ``ui`` object that will be used to run
  the command has not yet been created. Changes made here will affect ``ui``
  objects created after this, and in particular the ``ui`` that will be passed
  to ``runcommand``
* Command wraps (``extensions.wrapcommand``)
* Changes that need to be visible by other extensions: because initialization
  occurs in phases (all extensions run ``uisetup``, then all run ``extsetup``),
  a change made here will be visible by other extensions during ``extsetup``.
* Monkeypatches or function wraps (``extensions.wrapfunction``) of ``dispatch``
  module members
* Set up ``pre-*`` and ``post-*`` hooks. (DEPRECATED. ``uipopulate`` is
  preferred on Mercurial 4.9 and later.)
* ``pushkey`` setup

extsetup
--------

* Changes depending on the status of other extensions. (``if extensions.find(b'mq')``)
* Add a global option to all commands
* Extend revsets

uipopulate
----------

* Modify ``ui`` instance attributes and configuration variables.
* Changes to ``ui.__class__`` per instance.
* Set up all hooks per scoped configuration.

reposetup
---------

* Set up all hooks but ``pre-*`` and ``post-*``. (DEPRECATED. ``uipopulate`` is
  preferred on Mercurial 4.9 and later.)
* Modify configuration variables
* Changes to ``repo.__class__``, ``repo.dirstate.__class__``

See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaved_deltas for its introduction.

0. SCCS Weave

  To understand what linelog is, first we have a quick look at a simplified
  (with header removed) SCCS weave format, which is an implementation of the
  "Interleaved deltas" idea.

0.1 Basic SCCS Weave File Format

  A SCCS weave file consists of plain text lines. Each line is either a
  special instruction starting with "^A" or part of the content of the real
  file the weave tracks. There are 3 important operations, where REV denotes
  the revision number:

    ^AI REV, marking the beginning of an insertion block introduced by REV
    ^AD REV, marking the beginning of a deletion block introduced by REV
    ^AE REV, marking the end of the block started by "^AI REV" or "^AD REV"

  Note on revision numbers: For any two different revision numbers, one must
  be an ancestor of the other to make them comparable. This enforces linear
  history. Besides, the comparison functions (">=", "<") should be efficient.
  This means, if revisions are strings like git or hg, an external map is
  required to convert them into integers.

  For example, to represent the following changes:

    REV 1 | REV 2 | REV 3
    ------+-------+-------
    a     | a     | a
    b     | b     | 2
    c     | 1     | c
          | 2     |
          | c     |

  A possible weave file looks like:

    ^AI 1
    a
    ^AD 3
    b
    ^AI 2
    1
    ^AE 3
    2
    ^AE 2
    c
    ^AE 1

  An "^AE" does not always match its nearest operation ("^AI" or "^AD"). In
  the above example, "^AE 3" does not match the nearest "^AI 2" but "^AD 3".
  Therefore we need some extra information for "^AE". The SCCS weave uses a
  revision number. It could also be a boolean value about whether it is an
  insertion or a deletion (see section 0.4).
