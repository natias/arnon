	    compressed file. (Oliver Fuchs)
Solution:   Temporarily remove the 'a' and 'A' flags from 'cpo'.
Files:	    runtime/plugin/gzip.vim

Patch 6.1.206
Problem:    The script generated with ":mksession" doesn't work properly when
	    some commands are mapped.
Solution:   Use ":normal!" instead of ":normal".  And use ":wincmd" where
	    possible. (Muraoka Taro)
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/fold.c

Solution:   Reset the state of the iconv() descriptor. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.1.211
Problem:    The message "use ! to override" is confusing.

	    src/globals.h

Patch 6.1.212
Problem:    When Vim was started with "-R" ":new" creates a buffer

Patch 6.1.217
Problem:    When sourcing the same Vim script using a different name (symbolic
	    link or MS-Windows 8.3 name) it is listed twice with
	    ":scriptnames".  (Tony Mechelynck)
Solution:   Turn the script name into a full path before using it.  On Unix
	    compare inode/device numbers.

Problem:    When using a BufReadPost autocommand that changes the line count,
	    e.g., "$-1join", reloading a file that was changed outside Vim
	    does not work properly. (Alan G Isaac)
Solution:   Make the buffer empty before reading the new version of the file.
	    Save the lines in a dummy buffer, so that they can be put back
	    when reading the file fails.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/fileio.c, src/globals.h,
	    src/proto/buffer.pro

Patch 6.1.221
Problem:    Changing case may not work properly, depending on the current
	    locale.
Solution:   Add the 'casemap' option to let the user choose how changing case
	    is to be done.
	    Also fix lowering case when an UTF-8 character doesn't keep the
	    same byte length.

Patch 6.1.223 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When IME is activated 'iminsert' is set, but it might never
	    be reset when IME is disabled. (Muraoka Taro)
	    All systems: 'iminsert' is set to 2 when leaving Insert mode, even
	    when langmap is being used. (Peter Valach)
Solution:   Don't set "b_p_iminsert" in _OnImeNotify(). (Muraoka Taro)
	    Don't store the status of the input method in 'iminsert' when
	    'iminsert' is one.  Also for editing the command line and for
	    arguments to Normal mode commands.

Patch 6.1.225
Problem:    Using <C-O><C-^> in Insert mode has a delay when starting "vim -u
	    NONE" and ":set nocp hidden". (Emmanuel)  do_ecmd() uses
	    fileinfo(), the redraw is done after a delay to give the user time
	    to read the message.
Solution:   Put the message from fileio() in "keep_msg", so that the redraw is
	    done before the delay (still needed to avoid the mode message
	    overwrites the fileinfo() message).
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.1.226
Problem:    Using ":debug" with a ":normal" command may cause a hang.  (Colin

Solution:   Check for a ":" inside the variable name.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.1.228 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: The special output function for Hangul is used too often,
	    causing special handling for other situations to be skipped.
	    bInComposition is always FALSE, causing ImeGetTempComposition()
	    always to return NULL.
Solution:   Remove HanExtTextOut().  Delete the dead code around
	    bInComposition and ImeGetTempComposition().
Files:	    src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.1.229
Problem:    Win32: Conversion to/from often used codepages requires the iconv
	    library, which is not always available.
Solution:   Use standard MS-Windows functions for the conversion when
	    possible. (mostly by Glenn Maynard)
	    Also fixes missing declaration for patch 6.1.220.

Files:	    src/gui_w48.c

Patch 6.1.231
Problem:    Double clicking with the mouse to select a word does not work for
	    multibyte characters.
Solution:   Use vim_iswordc() instead of vim_isIDc().  This means 'iskeyword'
	    is used instead of 'isident'.  Also fix that mixing ASCII with
	    multibyte word characters doesn't work, the mouse class for
	    punctuation and word characters was mixed up.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.1.232 (depends on 6.1.226)
Problem:    Using ex_normal_busy while it might not be available. (Axel

	    Valach)
Solution:   Check "State" before resetting it to NORMAL.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.1.236
Problem:    Memory leaks when appending lines for ":diffget" or ":diffput" and
	    when reloading a changed buffer.
Solution:   Free a line after calling ml_append().
Files:	    src/diff.c, src/fileio.c

Patch 6.1.237
Problem:    Putting in Visual block mode does not work correctly when "$" was
	    used or when the first line is short.  (Christian Michon)
Solution:   First delete the selected text and then put the new text.  Save
	    and restore registers as necessary.

	    src/vim.h

Patch 6.1.238 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: The "icon=" argument for the ":menu" command does not
	    search for the bitmap file.
Solution:   Expand environment variables and search for the bitmap file.
	    (Vince Negri)
	    Make it consistent, use the same mechanism for X11 and GTK.
Files:	    src/gui.c src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_x11.c,
	    src/proto/gui.pro

Problem:    Giving an error for missing :endif or :endwhile when being
	    interrupted.
Solution:   Don't give these messages when interrupted.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.1.240 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 with BCC 5: CPU may be defined in the environment, which
	    causes a wrong argument for the compiler. (Walter Briscoe)
Solution:   Use CPUNR instead of CPU.
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak

Patch 6.1.241
Problem:    Something goes wrong when drawing or undrawing the cursor.
Solution:   Remember when the cursor invalid in a better way.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.1.242
Problem:    When pasting a large number of lines on the command line it is not
	    possible to interrupt. (Jean Jordaan)
Solution:   Check for an interrupt after each pasted line.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.1.243 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When the OLE version is started and wasn't registered, a
	    message pops up to suggest registering, even when this isn't
	    possible (when the registry is not writable).
Solution:   Check if registering is possible before asking whether it should
	    be done. (Walter Briscoe)
	    Also avoid restarting Vim after registering.
Files:	    src/if_ole.cpp

Patch 6.1.244
Problem:    Patch 6.1.237 was missing the diff for vim.h. (Igor Goldenberg)
Solution:   Include it here.
Files:	    src/vim.h

Patch 6.1.245
Problem:    Comparing with ignored case does not work properly for Unicode
	    with a locale where case folding an ASCII character results in a
	    multibyte character. (Glenn Maynard)
Solution:   Handle ignore-case compare for Unicode differently.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.1.246
Problem:    ":blast" goes to the first buffer if the last one is unlisted.
	    (Andrew Stryker)
Solution:   From the last buffer search backwards for the first listed buffer
	    instead of forwards.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.1.247
Problem:    ACL support doesn't always work properly.
