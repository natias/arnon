- Improved os_vms.txt.

Configure used fprintf() instead of printf() to check for __DATE__ and
__TIME__. (John Card II)

BeOS: Adjust computing the char_height and char_ascent.  Round them up
separately, avoids redrawing artifacts. (Mike Steed)

Fix a few multibyte problems in menu_name_skip(), set_reg_ic(), searchc() and
findmatchlimit(). (Taro Muraoka)

GTK GUI:
- With GTK 1.2.5 and later the scrollbars were not redrawn correctly.
- Adjusted the gtk_form_draw() function.
- SNiFF connection didn't work.
- 'mousefocus' was not working. (Dalecki)
- Some keys were not working with modifiers: Shift-Tab, Ctrl-Space and CTRL-@.


Patch 5.5.001
Problem:    Configure in the top directory did not pass on an argument with a
	    space correctly.  For example "./configure --previs="/My home".
	    (Stephane Chazelas)
Solution:   Use '"$@"' instead of '$*' to pass on the arguments.
Files:	    configure

Patch 5.5.002
Problem:    Compilation error for using "fds[] & POLLIN". (Jeff Walker)
Solution:   Use "fds[].revents & POLLIN".
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.5.003
Problem:    The autoconf check for sizeof(int) is wrong on machines where
	    sizeof(size_t) != sizeof(int).
Solution:   Use our own configure check.  Also fixes the warning for
	    cross-compiling.
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/configure

Patch 5.5.004
Problem:    On Unix it's not possible to interrupt ":sleep 100".
Solution:   Switch terminal to cooked mode while asleep, to allow a SIGINT to
	    wake us up.  But switch off echo, added TMODE_SLEEP.
Files:	    src/term.h, src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.5.005
Problem:    When using <f-args> with a user command, an empty argument to the
	    command resulted in one empty string, while no string was
	    expected.
Solution:   Catch an empty argument and pass no argument to the function.
	    (Paul Moore)
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.5.006
Problem:    Python: When platform-dependent files are in another directory
	    than the platform-independent files it doesn't work.
Solution:   Also check the executable directory, and add it to CFLAGS. (Tessa
	    Lau)
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/configure

Patch 5.5.007 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 OLE: Occasional crash when exiting while still being used
	    via OLE.
Solution:   Move OleUninitialize() to before deleting the application object.
	    (Vince Negri)
Files:	    src/if_ole.cpp

Patch 5.5.008
Problem:    10000@@ takes a long time and cannot be interrupted.
Solution:   Check for CTRL-C typed while in the loop to push the register.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 5.5.009
Problem:    Recent Sequent machines don't link with "-linet". (Kurtis Rader)
Solution:   Remove configure check for Sequent.
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/configure

Patch 5.5.010
Problem:    Ctags freed a memory block twice when exiting.  When out of
	    memory, a misleading error message was given.
Solution:   Update to ctags 3.3.2.  Also fixes a few other problems. (Darren
	    Hiebert)
Files:	    src/ctags/*

Patch 5.5.011
Problem:    After "CTRL-V s", the cursor jumps back to the start, while all
	    other operators leave the cursor on the last changed character.
	    (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Position cursor on last changed character, if possible.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.5.012
Problem:    Using CTRL-] in Visual mode doesn't work when the text includes a
	    space (just where it's useful). (Stefan Bittner)
Solution:   Don't escape special characters in a tag name with a backslash.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 5.5.013
Problem:    The ":append" and ":insert" commands allow using a leading
	    backslash in a line.  The ":source" command concatenates those
	    lines. (Heinlein)
Solution:   Add the 'C' flag in 'cpoptions' to switch off concatenation.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/option.h, runtime/doc/options.txt,
	    runtime/filetype.vim, runtime/scripts.vim

Patch 5.5.014
Problem:    When executing a register with ":@", the ":append" command would
	    get text lines with a ':' prepended. (Heinlein)
Solution:   Remove the ':' characters.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/globals.h

Patch 5.5.015
Problem:    When using ":g/pat/p", it's hard to see where the output starts,
	    the ":g" command is overwritten.  Vi keeps the ":g" command.
Solution:   Keep the ":g" command, but allow overwriting it with the report
	    for the number of changes.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 5.5.016 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Using regedit to install Vim in the popup menu requires the
	    user to confirm this in a dialog.
Solution:   Use "regedit /s" to avoid the dialog
Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 5.5.017
Problem:    If an error occurs when closing the current window, Vim could get
	    stuck in the error handling.
Solution:   Don't set curwin to NULL when closing the current window.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 5.5.018
Problem:    Absolute paths in shell scripts do not always work.
Solution:   Use /usr/bin/env to find out the path.
Files:	    runtime/doc/vim2html.pl, runtime/tools/efm_filter.pl,
	    runtime/tools/shtags.pl

Patch 5.5.019
Problem:    A function call in 'statusline' stops using ":q" twice from
	    exiting, when the last argument hasn't been edited.
Solution:   Don't decrement quitmore when executing a function. (Madsen)
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.5.020
Problem:    When the output of CTRL-D completion in the commandline goes all
	    the way to the last column, there is an empty line.
Solution:   Don't add a newline when the cursor wrapped already. (Madsen)
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 5.5.021
Problem:    When checking if a file name in the tags file is relative,
	    environment variables were not expanded.
Solution:   Expand the file name before checking if it is relative. (Madsen)
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 5.5.022
Problem:    When setting or resetting 'paste' the ruler wasn't updated.
Solution:   Update the status lines when 'ruler' changes because of 'paste'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 5.5.023
Problem:    When editing a new file and autocommands change the cursor
	    position, the cursor was moved back to the first non-white, unless
	    'startofline' was reset.
Solution:   Keep the new column, just like the line number.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 5.5.024 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: When using confirm() to put up a dialog without a
	    default button, the dialog would not have keyboard focus.
	    (Krishna)
Solution:   Always set focus to the dialog window.  Only set focus to a button
	    when a default one is specified.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.5.025
Problem:    When using "keepend" in a syntax region, a contained match that
	    includes the end-of-line could still force that region to
	    continue, if there is another contained match in between.
Solution:   Check the keepend_level in check_state_ends().
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 5.5.026
Problem:    When starting Vim in a white-on-black xterm, with 'bg' set to
	    "dark", and then starting the GUI with ":gui", setting 'bg' to
	    "light" in the gvimrc, the highlighting isn't set.  (Tsjokwing)
Solution:   Set the highlighting when 'bg' is changed in the gvimrc, even
	    though full_screen isn't set.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 5.5.027
Problem:    Unix: os_unix.c doesn't compile when XTERM_CLIP is used but
	    WANT_TITLE isn't. (Barnum)
Solution:   Move a few functions that are used by the X11 title and clipboard
	    and put another "#if" around it.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.5.028 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: When a file is dropped on Win32 gvim while at the ":"
	    prompt, the file is edited but the command line is actually still
	    there, the cursor goes back to command line on the next command.
	    (Krishna)
Solution:   When dropping a file or directory on gvim while at the ":" prompt,
	    insert the name of the file/directory.  Allows using the
	    file/directory name for any Ex command.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.5.029
Problem:    "das" at the end of the file didn't delete the last character of
	    the sentence.
Solution:   When there is no character after the sentence, make the operation
	    inclusive in current_sent().
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 5.5.030
Problem:    Unix: in os_unix.c, "term_str" is used, which is also defined in
	    vim.h as a macro. (wuxin)
Solution:   Renamed "term_str" to "buf" in do_xterm_trace().
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.5.031 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: When exiting Windows, gvim will leave swap files behind
	    and will be killed ungracefully. (Krishna)
Solution:   Catch the WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_ENDSESSION messages and try to
	    exit gracefully.  Allow the user to cancel the shutdown if there
	    is a changed buffer.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 5.5.032
Problem:    Patch 5.5.025 wasn't right.  And C highlighting was still not
	    working correctly for a #define.
Solution:   Added "excludenl" argument to ":syntax", to be able not to extend
	    a containing item when there is a match with the end-of-line.
Files:	    src/syntax.c, runtime/doc/syntax.txt, runtime/syntax/c.vim

Patch 5.5.033
Problem:    When reading from stdin, a long line in viminfo would mess up the
	    file message.  readfile() uses IObuff for keep_msg, which could be
	    overwritten by anyone.
Solution:   Copy the message from IObuff to msg_buf and set keep_msg to that.
	    Also change vim_fgets() to not use IObuff any longer.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 5.5.034
Problem:    "gvim -rv" caused a crash.  Using 't_Co' before it's set.
Solution:   Don't try to initialize the highlighting before it has been
	    initialized from main().
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 5.5.035
Problem:    GTK with XIM: Resizing with status area was messy, and
	    ":set guioptions+=b" didn't work.
Solution:   Make status area a separate widget, but not a separate window.
	    (Chi-Deok Hwang)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_f.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/multbyte.c

Patch 5.5.036
Problem:    The GZIP_read() function in $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim to
	    uncompress a file did not do detection for 'fileformat'.  This is
	    because the filtering is done with 'binary' set.
Solution:   Split the filtering into separate write, filter and read commands.
Files:	    runtime/vimrc_example.vim

Patch 5.5.037
Problem:    The "U" command didn't mark the buffer as changed. (McCormack)
Solution:   Set the 'modified' flag when using "U".
Files:	    src/undo.c

Patch 5.5.038
Problem:    When typing a long ":" command, so that the screen scrolls up,
	    causes the hit-enter prompt, even though the user just typed
	    return to execute the command.
Solution:   Reset need_wait_return if (part of) the command was typed in
	    getcmdline().
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c

Patch 5.5.039
Problem:    When using a custom status line, "%a" (file # of #) reports the
	    index of the current window for all windows.
Solution:   Pass a window pointer to append_arg_number(), and pass the window
	    being updated from build_stl_str_hl(). (Stephen P. Wall)
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/screen.c, src/proto/buffer.pro

Patch 5.5.040
Problem:    Multi-byte: When there is some error in xim_real_init(), it can
	    close XIM and return.  After this there can be a segv.
Solution:   Test "xic" for being non-NULL, don't set "xim" to NULL.  Also try
	    to find more matches for supported styles. (Sung-Hyun Nam)
Files:	    src/multbyte.c

Patch 5.5.041
Problem:    X11 GUI: CTRL-_ requires the SHIFT key only on some machines.
Solution:   Translate CTRL-- to CTRL-_. (Robert Webb)
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c

Patch 5.5.042
Problem:    X11 GUI: keys with ALT were assumed to be used for the menu, even
	    when the menu has been disabled by removing 'm' from 'guioptions'.
Solution:   Ignore keys with ALT only when gui.menu_is_active is set. (Raf)
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c

Patch 5.5.043
Problem:    GTK: Handling of fontset fonts was not right when 'guifontset'
	    contains exactly 14 times '-'.
Solution:   Avoid setting fonts when working with a fontset. (Sung-Hyun Nam)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 5.5.044
Problem:    pltags.pl contains an absolute path "/usr/local/bin/perl".  That
	    might not work everywhere.
Solution:   Use "/usr/bin/env perl" instead.
Files:	    runtime/tools/pltags.pl

Patch 5.5.045
Problem:    Using "this_session" variable does not work, requires preceding it
	    with "v:".  Default filename for ":mksession" isn't mentioned
	    in the docs. (Fisher)
Solution:   Support using "this_session" to be backwards compatible.
Files:	    src/eval.c, runtime/doc/options.txt

Patch 5.5.046 (extra)
Problem:    VMS: problems with path and filename.
Solution:   Truncate file name at last ';', etc. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

Files:	    src/structs.h, src/menu.c

Patch 5.5.048
Problem:    HP-UX 11: Compiling doesn't work, because both string.h and
	    strings.h are included. (Squassabia)
Solution:   The configure test for including both string.h and strings.h
	    must include <Xm/Xm.h> first, because it causes problems.
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/configure, src/config.h.in

Patch 5.5.049
Problem:    Unix: When installing Vim, the protection bits of files might be
	    influenced by the umask.
Solution:   Add $(FILEMOD) to Makefile. (Shetye)
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 5.5.050
Problem:    "z+" and "z^" commands are missing.
Solution:   Implemented "z+" and "z^".

Patch 5.5.051
Problem:    Several Unix systems have a problem with the optimization limits
	    check in configure.
Solution:   Removed the configure check, let the user add it manually in
	    Makefile or the environment.
Files:	    src/configure.in, src/configure, src/Makefile

Patch 5.5.052
Problem:    Crash when using a cursor key at the ATTENTION prompt. (Alberani)
Solution:   Ignore special keys at the console dialog.  Also ignore characters
	    > 255 for other uses of tolower() and toupper().
Files:	    src/menu.c, src/message.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 5.5.053
Problem:    Indenting is wrong after a function when 'cino' has "fs".  Another
	    problem when 'cino' has "{s".
Solution:   Put line after closing "}" of a function at the left margin.
	    Apply ind_open_extra in the right way after a '{'.
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/testdir/test3.in, src/testdir/test3.ok

Patch 5.5.054
Problem:    Unix: ":e #" doesn't work if the alternate file name contains a
	    space or backslash. (Hudacek)
Solution:   When replacing "#", "%" or other items that stand for a file name,
	    prepend a backslash before special characters.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.5.055
Problem:    Using "<C-V>$r-" in blockwise Visual mode replaces one character
	    beyond the end of the line. (Zivkov)
Solution:   Only replace existing characters.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.5.056
Problem:    After "z20<CR>" messages were printed at the old command line
	    position once.  (Veselinovic)
Solution:   Set msg_row and msg_col when changing cmdline_row in
	    win_setheight().
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 5.5.057
Problem:    After "S<Esc>" it should be possible to restore the line with "U".
	    (Veselinovic)
Solution:   Don't call u_clearline() in op_delete() when changing only one
	    line.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.5.058
Problem:    Using a long search pattern and then "n" causes the hit-enter
	    prompt.  (Krishna)
Solution:   Truncate the echoed pattern, like other messages.  Moved code for
	    truncating from msg_attr() to msg_strtrunc().
Files:	    src/message.c, src/proto/message.pro, src/search.c

Patch 5.5.059
Problem:    GTK GUI: When $term is invalid, using "gvim" gives an error
	    message, even though $term isn't really used.  (Robbins)
Solution:   When the GUI is about to start, skip the error messages for a
	    wrong $term.
Files:	    src/term.c

Patch 5.5.060 (extra)
Problem:    Dos 32 bit: When a directory in 'backupdir' doesn't exist, ":w"
	    causes the file to be renamed to "axlqwqhy.ba~". (Matzdorf)
Solution:   The code to work around a LFN bug in Windows 95 doesn't handle a
	    non-existing target name correctly.  When renaming fails, make
	    sure the file has its original name.  Also do this for the Win32
	    version, although it's unlikely that it runs into this problem.
Files:	    src/os_msdos.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 5.5.061
Problem:    When using "\:" in a modeline, the backslash is included in the
	    option value. (Mohsin)
Solution:   Remove one backslash before the ':' in a modeline.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, runtime/doc/options.txt

Patch 5.5.062 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 console: Temp files are created in the root of the current
	    drive, which may be read-only. (Peterson)
Solution:   Use the same mechanism of the GUI version: Use $TMP, $TEMP or the
	    current directory.  Cleaned up vim_tempname() a bit.

	    (Robert Webb)
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 5.5.064
Problem:    has("sniff") doesn't work correctly.

Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 5.5.065
Problem:    When dropping a file on Vim, the 'shellslash' option is not
	    effective. (Krishna)
Solution:   Fix the slashes in the dropped file names according to
	    'shellslash'.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, runtime/doc/options.txt

Patch 5.5.066
Problem:    For systems with backslash in file name: Setting a file name
	    option to a value starting with "\\machine" removed a backslash.
Solution:   Keep the double backslash for "\\machine", but do change
	    "\\\\machine" to "\\machine" for backwards compatibility.
Files:	    src/option.c, runtime/doc/options.txt

Patch 5.5.067
Problem:    With 'hlsearch' set, the pattern "\>" doesn't highlight the first

	    uninitialized index isn't used.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.5.069
Problem:    Shifting lines in blockwise Visual mode didn't set the 'modified'
	    flag.
Solution:   Do set the 'modified' flag.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 5.5.070
Problem:    When editing a new file, creating that file outside of Vim, then
	    editing it again, ":w" still warns for overwriting an existing
	    file. (Nam)
Solution:   The BF_NEW flag in the "b_flags" field wasn't cleared properly.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/fileio.c

Patch 5.5.071
Problem:    Using a matchgroup in a ":syn region", which is the same syntax
	    group as the region, didn't stop a contained item from matching in
	    the start pattern.
Solution:   Also push an item on the stack when the syntax ID of the
	    matchgroup is the same as the syntax ID of the region.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 5.5.072 (extra)
Problem:    Dos 32 bit: When setting 'columns' to a too large value, Vim may
	    crash, and the DOS console too.
Solution:   Check that the value of 'columns' isn't larger than the number of
	    columns that the BIOS reports.
Files:	    src/os_msdos.c, src/proto/os_msdos.pro, src/option.c

Patch 5.5.073 (extra)
Problem:    Win 32 GUI: The Find and Find/Replace dialogs didn't show the
	    "match case" checkbox.  The Find/Replace dialog didn't handle the
	    "match whole word" checkbox.
Solution:   Support the "match case" and "match whole word" checkboxes.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Files:	    runtime/syntax/2html.vim

Patch 5.6a.003
Problem:    Defining a function inside a function didn't give an error
	    message.  A missing ":endfunction" doesn't give an error message.
Solution:   Allow defining a function inside a function.
Files:	    src/eval.c, runtime/doc/eval.txt

Patch 5.6a.004
Problem:    A missing ":endwhile" or ":endif" doesn't give an error message.
	    (Johannes Zellner)

Patch 5.6a.010
Problem:    In a function, ":startinsert!" does not append to the end of the
	    line if a ":normal" command was used to move the cursor. (Fisher)
Solution:   Reset "w_set_curswant" to avoid that w_curswant is changed again.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 5.6a.011 (depends on 5.6a.004)

Patch 5.6a.016 (extra)
Problem:    Mac: Window size is restricted when starting.  Cannot drag the
	    window all over the desktop.

	    fixed number for the drag limits. (Axel Kielhorn)
Files:	    src/gui_mac.c

Patch 5.6a.017
Problem:    The "Paste" entry in popup menu for Visual, Insert and Cmdline
	    mode is in the wrong position. (Stol)
Solution:   Add priority numbers for all Paste menu entries.
Files:	    runtime/menu.vim

Patch 5.6a.018
Problem:    GTK GUI: submenu priority doesn't work.
	    Help dialog could be destroyed too soon.
	    When closing a dialog window (e.g. the "ATTENTION" one), Vim would
	    just hang.
	    When GTK theme is changed, Vim doesn't adjust to the new colors.
	    Argument for ":promptfind" isn't used.

	    src/proto/ui.pro, src/misc2.c

Patch 5.6a.019
Problem:    When trying to recover through NFS, which uses a large block size,
	    Vim might think the swap file is empty, because mf_blocknr_max is
	    zero.  (Scott McDermott)
Solution:   When computing the number of blocks of the file in mf_open(),
	    round up instead of down.
Files:	    src/memfile.c

Patch 5.6a.020
Problem:    GUI GTK: Could not set display for gvim.
Solution:   Add "-display" and "--display" arguments. (Marcin Dalecki)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 5.6a.021
Problem:    Recovering still may not work when the block size of the device
	    where the swap file is located is larger than 4096.
Solution:   Read block 0 with the minimal block size.
Files:	    src/memline.c, src/memfile.c, src/vim.h

Patch 5.6a.022 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: When an error in the vimrc causes a dialog to pop up

Solution:   In do_tag(), store tagstacklen before jumping to another buffer.
	    Check tagstackidx after jumping to another buffer.
	    Add extra check in win_split() if tagname isn't NULL.
Files:	    src/tag.c, src/window.c

Patch 5.6a.025 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: The tables for toupper() and tolower() are initialized
	    too late. (Mike Steed)
Solution:   Move the initialization to win32_init() and call it from main().

	    child has exited.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 5.6a.027 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: The "Edit with Vim" popup menu entry causes problems
	    for the Office toolbar.
Solution:   Use a shell extension dll. (Tianmiao Hu)
	    Added it to the install and uninstal programs, replaces the old
	    "Edit with Vim" menu registry entries.

macros/explorer.vim: A file browser script (M A Aziz Ahmed)


Fixed							*fixed-5.7*
-----

The 16 bit MS-DOS version is now compiled with Bcc 3.1 instead of 4.0.  The
executable is smaller.

When a "make test" failed, the output file was lost.  Rename it to
test99.failed to be able to see what went wrong.

After sourcing bugreport.vim, it's not clear that bugreport.txt has been
written in the current directory.  Edit bugreport.txt to avoid that.

Adding IME support when using Makefile.w32 didn't work. (Taro Muraoka)

Win32 console: Mouse drags were passed on even when the mouse didn't move.

Perl interface: In Buffers(), type of argument to SvPV() was int, should be
STRLEN. (Tony Leneis)

Problem with prototype for index() on AIX 4.3.0.  Added check for _AIX43 in
os_unix.h. (Jake Hamby)

Mappings in mswin.vim could break when some commands are mapped.  Add "nore"
to most mappings to avoid re-mapping.

modify_fname() made a copy of a file name for ":p" when it already was a full
path name, which is a bit slow.

Win32 with Borland C++ 5.5: Pass the path to the compiler on to xxd and ctags,
to avoid depending on $PATH.  Fixed "make clean".

Many fixes to Macintosh specific parts: (mostly by Dany StAmant)
- Only one Help menu.
- No more crash when removing a menu item.
- Support as External Editor for Codewarrior (still some little glitches).
- Popup menu support.
- Fixed crash when pasting after application switch.
- Color from rgb.txt properly displayed.
- 'isprint' default includes all chars above '~'. (Axel Kielhorn)
- mac_expandpath() was leaking memory.
- Add digraphs table. (Axel Kielhorn)
- Multi-byte support: (Kenichi Asai)
  Switch keyscript when going in/out of Insert mode.
  Draw multibyte character correctly.
  Don't use mblen() but highest bit of char to detect multibyte char.
  Display value of multibyte in statusline (also for other systems).
- mouse button was not initialized properly to MOUSE_LEFT when
  USE_CTRLCLICKMENU not defined.
- With Japanese SJIS characters: Make "w", "b", and "e" work
  properly.  (Kenichi Asai)
- Replaced old CodeWarrior file os_mac.CW9.hqx with os_mac.cw5.sit.hqx.

Fixes for VMS: (Zoltan Arpadffy) (also see patch 5.6.045 below)
- Added Makefile_vms.mms and vimrc.vms to src/testdir to be able to run the
  tests.
- Various fixes.
- Set 'undolevels' to 1000 by default.
- Made mch_settitle() equivalent to the one in os_unix.c.

RiscOS: A few prototypes for os_riscos.c were outdated.  Generate prototypes
automatically.


Previously released patches:

Files:	    runtime/syntax/vim.vim

Patch 5.6.003
Problem:    GTK GUI: Loading a user defined toolbar bitmap gives a warning
	    about the colormap.  Probably because the window has not been
	    opened yet.
Solution:   Use gdk_pixmap_colormap_create_from_xpm() to convert the xpm file.
	    (Keith Radebaugh)
Files:	    src/gui_gtk.c

Patch 5.6.004 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI with IME: When setting 'guifont' to "*", the font
	    requester appears twice.

Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 5.6.007 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 IME: Font is not changed when screen font is changed. And
	    IME composition window does not trace the cursor.
Solution:   Initialize IME font.  When cursor is moved, set IME composition
	    window with ImeSetCompositionWindow().  Add call to
	    ImmReleaseContext() in several places. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/gui.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/proto/gui_w32.pro

Patch 5.6.008 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: When two files exist with the same name but different case
	    (through NFS or Samba), fixing the file name case could cause the
	    wrong one to be edited.
Solution:   Prefer a perfect match above a match while ignoring case in
	    fname_case().  (Flemming Madsen)
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

	    backwards.  Count a Tab for two characters to align the ":ls" list.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 5.6.011
Problem:    When 'columns' is huge (using a tiny font) and 'statusline' is

Patch 5.6.016
Problem:    When deleting a search string from history from inside a mapping,
	    another entry is deleted too. (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Reset last_maptick when deleting the last entry of the search
	    history.  Also: Increment maptick when starting a mapping from
	    typed characters to avoid a just added search string being
	    overwritten or removed from history.
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/getchar.c

Patch 5.6.017
Problem:    ":s/e/\^M/" should replace an "e" with a CTRL-M, not split the

Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 5.6.026 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 GUI: Toolbar bitmaps are searched for in
	    $VIMRUNTIME/bitmaps, while GTK looks in $VIM/bitmaps. (Keith
	    Radebaugh)
Solution:   Use $VIM/bitmaps for both, because these are not part of the
	    distribution but defined by the user.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c, runtime/doc/gui.txt
