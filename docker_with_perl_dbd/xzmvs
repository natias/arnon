From F<i_quadmath.U>:

This variable conditionally defines C<I_QUADMATH>, which indicates
to the C program that it should include <quadmath.h>.

=item C<i_rpcsvcdbm>

From F<i_dbm.U>:

This variable conditionally defines the C<I_RPCSVC_DBM> symbol, which
indicates to the C program that <rpcsvc/dbm.h> exists and should
be included.  Some System V systems might need this instead of <dbm.h>.

=item C<i_sgtty>

From F<i_termio.U>:

This variable conditionally defines the C<I_SGTTY> symbol, which
indicates to the C program that it should include <sgtty.h> rather
than <termio.h>.

=item C<i_shadow>

From F<i_shadow.U>:

This variable conditionally defines the C<I_SHADOW> symbol, and indicates
whether a C program should include <shadow.h>.

=item C<i_socks>

From F<i_socks.U>:

This variable conditionally defines the C<I_SOCKS> symbol, and indicates
whether a C program should include <socks.h>.

=item C<i_stdbool>

From F<i_stdbool.U>:

This variable conditionally defines the C<I_STDBOOL> symbol, which
indicates to the C program that <stdbool.h> exists and should
be included.

=item C<i_stdint>

From F<i_stdint.U>:

This variable conditionally defines the C<I_STDINT> symbol, which
indicates to the C program that <stdint.h> exists and should
be included.
