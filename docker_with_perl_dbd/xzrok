<p>The error table compiler is named <code>compile_et</code>.  It takes one
argument, the pathname of a file (ending in &lsquo;<samp>.et</samp>&rsquo;, e.g.,
&lsquo;<samp>dsc_err.et</samp>&rsquo;) containing an error table source file.  It parses the
error table, and generates two output files &ndash; a C header file
(&lsquo;<samp>discuss_err.h</samp>&rsquo;) which contains definitions of the numerical values
of the error codes defined in the error table, and a C source file which
should be compiled and linked with the executable.  The header file must be
included in the source of a module which wishes to reference the error
codes defined; the object module generated from the C code may be linked in
to a program which wishes to use the printed forms of the error codes.

<span id="Run_002dtime-support-routines-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">5 Run-time support routines</h2>

<p>Any source file which uses the routines supplied with or produced by the
com_err package should include the header file <samp>&lt;com_err.h&gt;</samp>.  It
contains declarations and definitions which may be needed on some systems.
(Some functions cannot be referenced properly without the return type
declarations in this file.  Some functions may work properly on most
architectures even without the header file, but relying on this is not
recommended.)
</p>
<p>The run-time support routines and variables provided via this package
include the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">void initialize_<var>xxxx</var>_error_table (void);
</pre></div>

<p>One of these routines is built by the error compiler for each error table.
It makes the <var>xxxx</var> error table &ldquo;known&rdquo; to the error reporting
system.  By convention, this routine should be called in the initialization
routine of the <var>xxxx</var> library.  If the library has no initialization
routine, some combination of routines which form the core of the library
should ensure that this routine is called.  It is not advised to leave it
the caller to make this call.
</p>
<p>There is no harm in calling this routine more than once.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define ERROR_TABLE_BASE_<var>xxxx</var> <var>nnnnn</var>L
</pre></div>

<p>This symbol contains the value of the first error code entry in the
specified table.
This rarely needs be used by the
programmer.
</p>
<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-char"><span class="category">Function: </span><span><em>const</em> <strong>char</strong> <em>*error_message (long <var>code</var>);</em><a href='#index-char' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This routine returns the character string error message associated
with <code>code</code>; if this is associated with an unknown error table, or
if the code is associated with a known error table but the code is not
in the table, a string of the form &lsquo;<samp>Unknown code <var>xxxx nn</var></samp>&rsquo; is
returned, where <var>xxxx</var> is the error table name produced by
reversing the compaction performed on the error table number implied
by that error code, and <var>nn</var> is the offset from that base value.
</p>
<p>Although this routine is available for use when needed, its use should be
left to circumstances which render <code>com_err</code> (below) unusable.
</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-com_005ferr"><span class="category">Function: </span><span><em>void</em> <strong>com_err</strong> <em>(const char *<var>whoami</var>, long <var>error_code</var>, const char *<var>format</var>, ...);</em><a href='#index-com_005ferr' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This routine provides an alternate way to print error messages to
standard error; it allows the error message to be passed in as a
parameter, rather than in an external variable.  <em>Provide grammatical
context for &ldquo;message.&rdquo;</em>
</p>
<p>The module reporting the error should be passed in via <var>whoami</var>.
If <var>format</var> is <code>(char *)NULL</code>, the formatted message will not be
printed.  <var>format</var> may not be omitted.
</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl class="def">

<dd>
<p>This routine provides an interface, equivalent to <code>com_err</code> above,
which may be used by higher-level variadic functions (functions which
accept variable numbers of arguments).
</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-_002aset_005fcom_005ferr_005fhook"><span class="category">Function: </span><span><em>void</em> <strong>*set_com_err_hook</strong> <em>(void (*<var>proc</var>) (const char *<var>whoami</var>, long <var>error_code</var>, va_list <var>args</var>) (const char *<var>whoami</var>, long <var>error_code</var>, va_list <var>args</var>));</em><a href='#index-_002aset_005fcom_005ferr_005fhook' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>

<dd>
<p>These two routines allow a routine to be dynamically substituted for
&lsquo;<samp>com_err</samp>&rsquo;.  After &lsquo;<samp>set_com_err_hook</samp>&rsquo; has been called,
calls to &lsquo;<samp>com_err</samp>&rsquo; will turn into calls to the new hook routine.
&lsquo;<samp>reset_com_err_hook</samp>&rsquo; turns off this hook.  This may intended to
be used in daemons (to use a routine which calls <cite>syslog(3)</cite>), or
in a window system application (which could pop up a dialogue box).
</p>
<p>If a program is to be used in an environment in which simply printing
messages to the <code>stderr</code> stream would be inappropriate (such as in a
daemon program which runs without a terminal attached),
<code>set_com_err_hook</code> may be used to redirect output from <code>com_err</code>.
The following is an example of an error handler which uses <cite>syslog(3)</cite>
as supplied in BSD 4.3:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
#include &lt;syslog.h&gt;

/* extern openlog (const char * name, int logopt, int facility); */
/* extern syslog (int priority, char * message, ...); */

void hook (const char * whoami, long code,
           const char * format, va_list args)
{
    char buffer[BUFSIZ];
    static int initialized = 0;
    if (!initialized) {
        openlog (whoami,
                 LOG_NOWAIT|LOG_CONS|LOG_PID|LOG_NDELAY,
                 LOG_DAEMON);
        initialized = 1;
    }
    vsprintf (buffer, format, args);
    syslog (LOG_ERR, &quot;%s %s&quot;, error_message (code), buffer);
}
</pre></div>

<p>After making the call
<code>set_com_err_hook (hook);</code>,
any calls to <code>com_err</code> will result in messages being sent to the
<var>syslogd</var> daemon for logging.
The name of the program, &lsquo;<samp>whoami</samp>&rsquo;, is supplied to the
&lsquo;<samp>openlog()</samp>&rsquo; call, and the message is formatted into a buffer and
passed to <code>syslog</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that since the extra arguments to <code>com_err</code> are passed by
reference via the <code>va_list</code> value <code>args</code>, the hook routine may
place any form of interpretation on them, including ignoring them.  For
consistency, <code>printf</code>-style interpretation is suggested, via
<code>vsprintf</code> (or <code>_doprnt</code> on BSD systems without full support for
the ANSI C library).

</div>
<span id="Coding-Conventions-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">6 Coding Conventions</h2>

<p>The following conventions are just some general stylistic conventions
to follow when writing robust libraries and programs.  Conventions
similar to this are generally followed inside the UNIX kernel and most
routines in the Multics operating system.  In general, a routine
either succeeds (returning a zero error code, and doing some side
effects in the process), or it fails, doing minimal side effects; in
any event, any invariant which the library assumes must be maintained.
</p>
<p>In general, it is not in the domain of non user-interface library
routines to write error messages to the user&rsquo;s terminal, or halt the
process.  Such forms of &ldquo;error handling&rdquo; should be reserved for
failures of internal invariants and consistency checks only, as it
provides the user of the library no way to clean up for himself in the
event of total failure.
</p>
<p>Library routines which can fail should be set up to return an error
code.  This should usually be done as the return value of the
function; if this is not acceptable, the routine should return a
&ldquo;null&rdquo; value, and put the error code into a parameter passed by
reference.
</p>
<p>Routines which use the first style of interface can be used from
user-interface levels of a program as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">{
    if ((code = initialize_world(getuid(), random())) != 0) {
        com_err(&quot;demo&quot;, code,
                &quot;when trying to initialize world&quot;);
        exit(1);
    }
    if ((database = open_database(&quot;my_secrets&quot;, &amp;code))==NULL) {
        com_err(&quot;demo&quot;, code,
                &quot;while opening my_secrets&quot;);
        exit(1);
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>A caller which fails to check the return status is in error.  It is
possible to look for code which ignores error returns by using lint;
look for error messages of the form &ldquo;foobar returns value which is
sometimes ignored&rdquo; or &ldquo;foobar returns value which is always
ignored.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Since libraries may be built out of other libraries, it is often necessary
for the success of one routine to depend on another.  When a lower level
routine returns an error code, the middle level routine has a few possible
options.  It can simply return the error code to its caller after doing
some form of cleanup, it can substitute one of its own, or it can take
corrective action of its own and continue normally.  For instance, a
library routine which makes a &ldquo;connect&rdquo; system call to make a network
connection may reflect the system error code <code>ECONNREFUSED</code>
(Connection refused) to its caller, or it may return a &ldquo;server not
available, try again later,&rdquo; or it may try a different server.
</p>
<p>Cleanup which is typically necessary may include, but not be limited
to, freeing allocated memory which will not be needed any more,
unlocking concurrency locks, dropping reference counts, closing file
descriptors, or otherwise undoing anything which the procedure did up
to this point.  When there are a lot of things which can go wrong, it
is generally good to write one block of error-handling code which is
branched to, using a goto, in the event of failure.  A common source
of errors in UNIX programs is failing to close file descriptors on
error returns; this leaves a number of &ldquo;zombied&rdquo; file descriptors
open, which eventually causes the process to run out of file
descriptors and fall over.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">{
    FILE *f1=NULL, *f2=NULL, *f3=NULL;
    int status = 0;

    if ( (f1 = fopen(FILE1, &quot;r&quot;)) == NULL) {
        status = errno;
        goto error;
    }

    /*
     * Crunch for a while
     */

    if ( (f2 = fopen(FILE2, &quot;w&quot;)) == NULL) {
        status = errno;
        goto error;
    }

    if ( (f3 = fopen(FILE3, &quot;a+&quot;)) == NULL) {
        status = errno;
            goto error;
    }

    /*
     * Do more processing.
     */
    fclose(f1);
    fclose(f2);
    fclose(f3);
    return 0;

error:
    if (f1) fclose(f1);
    if (f2) fclose(f2);

		========================================

Abstract
--------

Debian uses a default version of GCC for most packages; however, some
packages require another version.  So, Debian allows several versions
of GCC to coexist on the same system, and selects the default version
by means of the gcc-defaults package, which creates symbolic links as
appropriate.

FIXME: Needs update for stretch

Versions of GCC present in Debian Stretch
-----------------------------------------

- GCC 5 is the default compiler for all frontends on all architectures
  except for Ada.

- GCC 4.9 is the default compiler for Ada.

- GCC 4.8 was removed for the release of Stretch.

- GCC 4.7 was removed for the release of Jessie.

- GCC 3.3 is not provided anymore; it is used to build libstdc++5 on
  the amd64 and i386 architectures. It is expected that libstdc++5 is
  not available anymore for the release following Lenny.

- GCC 2.95 and GCC 2.7.2.3 were removed for the release of Lenny.

How are the default compilers selected?
---------------------------------------

Starting in Debian 3.0, there is now a gcc-defaults package set. This
creates the actual packages for gcc, gnat, g++, gobjc,
gdc and gpc.  These packages will depend on the corresponding default
compiler for that architecture. For Debian 5.0 for example, "gcc"
depends on "gcc-5", which means that the "gcc-5" package will
install a binary called "gcc-5", which is symlinked to in the "gcc"
package as "gcc".

This may seem confusing, but what it allows you do to is install more
than one version of the GCC compiler collection at the same time,
making sure you are always using the one preferred for that
architecture. To use the other compiler, simply set CC=gcc-5, or
similar.

The default compiler versions for Debian GNU/Linux on amd64 are
(minor version numbers omitted):

	cpp		: cpp-12
	gcc		: gcc-12
	g++		: g++-12
	gfortran	: gfortran-12
	gccgo		: gccgo-12
	gobjc		: gobjc-12
	gobjc++		: gobjc++-12
	gdc		: gdc-12

Most of the documentation for GCC including the manual pages is
licensed under the GFDL and therefore not included in the main section.

Thanks to gcc-defaults, each architecture can choose its own preferred
compiler for each language, and that preference can change without
requiring a complete rebuild of both compiler packages for all
architectures.

Practical implications
----------------------

The most important practical implications are in the merging/linking
of object files built with different compilers; If you use the 4.9
C compiler, you should use the gcc-4.9 compiler driver for all your
work.  When configuring sources, use

    CC=gcc-4.9 ./configure <configure options> 	# bash
    setenv CC gcc-4.9; ./configure <options>	# csh

When calling make, use make CC=gcc-4.9.

libstdc++ ABI
-------------

Starting with Debian 8.0 (stretch), gcc-5 and newer compiler versions
now provides a stable libcxx11 ABI, and stable support for C++11 (GCC
version before 5 called this supported experimental).  This required
some changes in the libstdc++ ABI, and now libstdc++6 provides a dual
ABI, the classic libcxx98 ABI, and the new libcxx11.  Many C++ using
packages were rebuilt; it is likely that third party applications will
need rebuilds too. See https://wiki.debian.org/GCC5.

C Application Binary Interface
------------------------------

Starting with Debian 4.0 (lenny), gcc-4.1 and newer compilers do
support the long double datatype with 128bit on the alpha, powerpc,
s390 and sparc architectures.  Libraries and applications using this
datatype have to be rebuilt using the compiler versions in Lenny
unless these depend on libc6/libc6.1 and libstdc++6, which still have
compatibility with a 64bit long double datatype.

gcc/g++/... are not handled using alternatives
----------------------------------------------

The symlinks in /usr/bin (gcc, g++, ...) are not handled using the Debian
alternative mechanism. There are differences in the architecture specific
ABI on some architectures and the C++ ABI differs as well. Having the
symlinks managed by alternatives doesn't allow reliable builds with the
same major/minor version of the compiler. To use another compiler version,
set the appropriate environment variables as described above in the section
"Practical implications".

C++ libraries
-------------

To use the libstdc++ library for debugging (found in the
libstd++6-<GCC version>-dbg package), add /usr/lib/debug to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For gdb to display the source you need to get the
correspondig gcc-X.Y source package, unpack the source and point gdb
to the location of the source (dir directive).

C++ Application Binary Interface
--------------------------------

Sometimes, the C++ ABI of GCC changes.  It is impossible to link
object files that obey different ABIs into an executable.  When the
ABI changes, Debian provides a new version of libstdc++ with a new
soname.

Version 4 of the ABI was used by GCC 3.0 and 3.1; it is no longer
supported.

Version 5 of the ABI is common to GCC 3.2 and 3.3; GCC 3.3
provides libstdc++5. It is only supported as a runtime library.

Version 6 of the ABI is common to GCC 3.4 and later; GCC 4.3 provides
libstdc++6.

libstdc++6 in GCC 5 provides a dual ABI, see https://wiki.debian.org/GCC5.

===================

This file will try to document some of the interfaces that dpkg makes
available to frontends or that expects them to use, which are currently
not covered by any other type of documentation.


Database Locking
----------------

Any frontend needing to make sure no write operation is currently happening,
and no other frontend is running should first acquire the frontend lock at
¬´<admindir>/lock-frontend¬ª, and then acquire the dpkg database lock at
¬´<admindir>/lock¬ª. When the frontend invokes dpkg, it should set the
environment variable DPKG_FRONTEND_LOCKED (to prevent dpkg from acquiring
the frontend lock), and then release the dpkg database lock, which will be
acquired by dpkg itself. This way no other frontend following this protocol
can race to perform operations while another one has one in progress.

These locks must be file record locks (i.e. fcntl(2) advisory locking), and
the whole file should be locked, as that's the most portable way to perform
this operation; this can be achieved by using start=0, len=0 and
whence=SEEK_SET.

=============================

Status: draft, experimental
URL: https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/Spec/ProtectedField

Summary
-------

The goal of the following proposal is to standardize a field to split
part of the ¬´Essential¬ª packages, and add support for it in the package
management stack. There is currently an Important field, that has the
correct semantics but has a very confusing name and is only supported
by apt anyway, so this new field would phase out that one.

Background
----------

Our current use of ¬´Essential: yes¬ª is confused, and it includes several
conflated things, some of which would be worth splitting up.

We use ¬´Essential¬ª to:

  * Denote that a package must be always installed and cannot be
    removed (easily), because it is essential to the system in some way.
  * Denote that a package must be functional even when just unpacked
    (after having been configured once / fully bootstrapped).
  * Mark auto-vivification, by making front-ends either complain very
    loudly or reinstalling these packages when missing.
  * Minimize dependency loops, by making these dependencies implicit.

One problem is that the first point above includes being essential for
the packaging system during upgrades/installation, for the operation
of the system in general, and for the operation of the system during
boot.

The latter is not always necessary though, for example within a chroot,
or some types of containers. There has been work on trying to trim down
the pseudo-essential set as can be seen from:

  <https://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/EssentialOnDiet>
  <https://wiki.debian.org/BusterPriorityRequalification>

And several of these switches made use of a pre-existing field called
¬´Important¬ª, defined and currently only supported by apt, which had the
following properties:

  * These packages are not required to be installed.
  * They do not have to be usable while unconfigured.
  * Dependencies need to be spelled out.

Proposal
--------

The proposal would be to add support for a new Protected field, with the
following properties:

  * Protected packages should not be trivial to remove (require a force
    option for example, like ¬´Essential¬ª).
  * Protected packages should not be required to be installed (i.e. once
    removed they should not be automatically brought back by a front-end,
    unlike ¬´Essential¬ª).
  * Protected packages must be depended on explicitly (unlike ¬´Essential¬ª).
  * Protected packages must be functional even when unpacked (think of
    a boot loader or an init system; like ¬´Essential¬ª). [XXX: This one is
    not entirely clear and might not match reality anyway, for example kernels,
    which might require building an initramfs, etc.]

This would make it possible to phase out the current ¬´Important¬ª field
usage (because it has a name too confusing relative to the ¬´Priority¬ª
value; and has small tooling coverage) and the usage of ¬´Essential¬ª for
at least packages involved in the boot process, and perhaps also for
packages essential for operation of the system in general (in contrast
to packages required for the packaging system).

==========================

Status: recommendation, stable
Version: 1.0

Background
----------

Traditionally, Debian packages have required (fake)root privileges for some
of the "debian/rules" targets. This has required also a split between build
and binary targets; making the builds slower, due to the increased amount
of invocations of "debian/rules" and the overhead of using fakeroot(1) or
equivalent fake environments, or less secure due to the increased dangers
of running under real root via sudo or equivalent.

On this document when talking about "(fake)root" privileges, it will refer
to any mechanism, supported by the dpkg-buildpackage "-r/--root-command"
option, that can provide either a real or faked root user environment.

Specification
-------------

We add a new field to the "Source" stanza of debian/control:

  Rules-Requires-Root: no | binary-targets | <implementations-keywords>

The case sensitive values are defined as:

 * If "no", then "debian/rules binary" will not require root at all (not even
   fakeroot).
   - If the "no" keyword is used, it MUST be the only keyword in that field
     and MUST appear exactly once.

 * If "binary-targets", then "debian/rules binary" (etc.) must always be run
   under (fake)root. This is the default/status quo.

 * <implementations-keywords> will be a space separated list of keywords which
   define when root is required.

   - Keywords consists of <namespace>/<cases>. The "namespace" part cannot
     contain "/" or whitespace. The "cases" part cannot contain whitespace.
     Furthermore, both parts MUST consist entirely of printable ASCII
     characters.

   - Each tool/package will define a namespace named after itself and provide
     a number of cases where (fake)root is required.
     (See also "Implementation provided keywords".)

   - When "Rules-Requires-Root" is set to <implementations-keywords>, the
     builder (i.e. whatever is executing debian/rules) will expose an
     interface that is used to run a command under (fake)root via the
     "Gain Root API". If the builder cannot provide such a command, it
     MUST behave like "Rules-Requires-Root" was set to "binary-targets",
     i.e. run "debian/rules binary" under (fake)root.

When the builder supports this specification, it MUST notify this fact to
the rules file via the "DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT" environment variable, with
the value it has obtained from the Rules-Requires-Root field or some builder
specific override mechanism, which will denote the level of support the
builder has chosen to commit to take effect during the build. When set,
it MUST be a valid value for the Rules-Requires-Root field. If unset,
the build system SHOULD assume that the builder does not recognize the
Rules-Requires-Root field at all.

It is always permissible for a builder to ignore this field and fall back to
running the binary targets under (fake)root. This is to ensure backwards
compatibility when builds are performed by legacy builders or older versions
of the tooling.

Tools called from the rules file MUST cope gracefully with being called under
(fake)root even when Rules-Requires-Root is set to a value that implies they
should not be (e.g. "no"). However, they MUST NOT attempt to run processes
under (fake)root when run as a regular user when Rules-Requires-Root does
not list any keywords they respond to.

Tools MUST gracefully ignore valid unknown keywords outside their namespace.
They MAY warn about unknown keywords inside their namespace.

The value of this field MUST NOT change the content of the package in any
way. Notably, packages that are bit-for-bit reproducible MUST still provide
bit-for-bit identical results even when the field is ignored.

Implementation provided keywords
--------------------------------

Keywords provided by various implementations:

 * dpkg/target-subcommand: When the package needs to run a given command
   under (fake)root within the "debian/rules" files directly, this MUST be
   declared via this keyword.

 * dpkg/target/<target-name>: When a specific "debian/rules" unofficial
   target (none of the root-requiring "binary-indep", "binary-arch", "binary",
   "clean", nor the non-root-requiring "build-indep", "build-arch", "build")
   needs to be run under (fake)root, this MUST be declared via this dynamic
   keyword, where <target-name> is the name of the "debian/rules" target.

 * debhelper/upstream-make-install: The dh_auto_install command will run
   the "install" target from the upstream's Makefile under (fake)root (for
   the "makefile" build system or one derived from it).

Gain Root API
-------------

The builder will provide a command to promote a given command to (fake)root
by exposing it in the environment variable "DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD". Tools that
need this promotion will then use it like the following:

    $DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD cmd-that-needs-root ...

This command is subject to the same requirements as the "gain-root-command"
that dpkg-buildpackage accepts via its "-r/--root-command" option, which
means that it can contain space-separated parameters. If dpkg-buildpackage is
called with "-r/--root-command", then dpkg-buildpackage shall use that value
as the value for "DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD". The command SHOULD preserve all the
environment variables, unmodified.

The variable SHOULD only be provided when there is a need for it. Notably
when "Rules-Requires-Root" is either "no" or "binary-targets" the variable
SHOULD NOT be defined.

(The "DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD" variable used to be named "DPKG_GAIN_ROOT_CMD"
starting with dpkg 1.19.0 and before dpkg 1.19.1 when this specification
got released as stable. The old name MUST not be used.)

Common cases
------------

 * Upstream installation insists on "sudo make install"-like behaviour.
   => Use dpkg/target-subcommand or debhelper/upstream-make-install.

 * Files shipped in the package must be owned by another user than root.
   => Not covered; use "binary-targets" for now until dpkg+debhelper
      provides the required interface.

Prototyping/preparation
=======================

dpkg side
---------

dpkg-deb --build provides the --root-owner-group option so that dh_builddeb
or direct calls can control the owner/group file values w/o requiring
(fake)root.

dpkg-buildpackage must export DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD when necessary (for
prototyping, doing this unconditionally would be fine).


debhelper side
--------------

When the field is present:

 * dh_testroot will behave as usual when Rules-Requires-Root is not present
   or set to "binary-targets".

 * dh_testroot will be a no-op when Rules-Requires-Root is set to "no".

 * Otherwise, dh_testroot will either verify that it is run under (fake)root
   (as usual) OR assert that DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD is defined.

 * debhelper build systems will be patched to check for the
   "debhelper/upstream-make-install" keyword and use the "Gain Root API"
   accordingly.

 * All other (src:)debhelper commands will skip their calls to chown
   (currently they just reset them to "0:0" anyway).

With the above, a default "dh $@" will no longer require (fake)root when
built (and Rules-Requires-Root is "no").

Prototyping:

 * During prototyping, dh_builddeb can wrap the dpkg-deb --build call with
   fakeroot (when not already root).

========

Introduction
------------

A dpkg trigger is a facility that allows events caused by one package
but of interest to another package to be recorded and aggregated, and
processed later by the interested package.  This feature simplifies
various registration and system-update tasks and reduces duplication
of processing.

(NB: Triggers are intended for events that occur during package
installation, not events that occur in general operation.)


Concepts
--------

Each trigger is named, and at any time zero or more packages may be
interested in it.

We currently envisage three kinds of triggers:
 * Explicit triggers.  These can be activated by any program
   by running dpkg-trigger (at any time, but ideally from a maintainer
   script).
 * File triggers.  These are activated automatically by dpkg
   when a matching file is installed, upgraded or removed as part
   of a package.  They may also be explicitly activated by running
   dpkg-trigger.
 * Future kinds of special triggers, which are activated by magic code
   in dpkg itself.  Currently none are defined besides file triggers.

A trigger is always activated by a particular package.

Trigger names contain only printing 7-bit ascii characters (no
whitespace).  Each trigger kind has a distinct subset of the trigger
name space so that the kind can be determined from the name.  After we
run out of straightforward syntaxes, we will use <kind>:<details>.

When a trigger is activated, it becomes pending for every package
which is interested in the trigger at that time.  Each package has a
list of zero or more pending triggers.  Repeated activation of the
same trigger has no additional effect.  Note that in general a trigger
will not be processed immediately when it is activated; processing is
deferred until it is convenient (as described below).

At a trigger activation, the interested packages(s) are added to the
triggering package's list of triggers-awaited packages (unless the
trigger has been configured to not require it); the triggering
package is said to await the trigger processing.

A package which has pending triggers, or which awaits triggers, is not
considered properly installed.  There are two new dpkg status values,
‚Äòtriggers-pending‚Äô and ‚Äòtriggers-awaited‚Äô, which lie between
‚Äòconfig-failed‚Äô and ‚Äòinstalled‚Äô.


Details - Overview table
------------------------

  Status      Pending   Awaited   Satisfies  Remedy
              triggers  triggers  Depends

  unpacked    never      maybe    No    postinst configure
  c.-failed   never      maybe    No    postinst configure (when requested)
  t.-awaited  yes        always   No    postinst triggered + fix awaited pkg(s)
  t.-awaited  no         always   No    fix awaited package(s)
  t.-pending  always     never    Yes   postinst triggered
  installed   never      never    Yes   n/a

Packages in t-awaited and t-pending demand satisfaction of their
dependencies just like packages in installed.


Details - triggering package
----------------------------

When a package <T> activates a trigger in which a package <I> is
interested, <I> is added to the list of packages whose trigger
processing is awaited by <T>. Zero or more packages <I> may be added as a
result of any particular trigger activation, depending on how many
packages were interested. (If <T> chooses, explicit trigger activation
using dpkg-trigger of <I> by <T> need not make <T> become triggers-awaited
in this way.)

A package which awaits trigger processing but would otherwise be
‚Äòinstalled‚Äô or ‚Äòtriggers-pending‚Äô is considered to be in state
