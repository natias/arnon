You don't need to have /usr/ucb/ in your PATH to build perl.  If you
want /usr/ucb/ in your PATH anyway, make sure that /usr/ucb/ is NOT
in your PATH before the directory containing the right C compiler.

=head3 Sun's C Compiler

If you use Sun's C compiler, make sure the correct directory
(usually /opt/SUNWspro/bin/) is in your PATH (before /usr/ucb/).

=head3 GCC

If you use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and complete.
perl versions since 5.6.0 build fine with gcc > 2.8.1 on Solaris >=
2.6.

You must Configure perl with

 $ sh Configure -Dcc=gcc

If you don't, you may experience strange build errors.

If you have updated your Solaris version, you may also have to update
your gcc.  For example, if you are running Solaris 2.6 and your gcc is
installed under /usr/local, check in /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib and make
sure you have the appropriate directory, sparc-sun-solaris2.6/ or
i386-pc-solaris2.6/.  If gcc's directory is for a different version of
Solaris than you are running, then you will need to rebuild gcc for
your new version of Solaris.

You can get a precompiled version of gcc from
L<http://www.sunfreeware.com/> or L<http://www.blastwave.org/>. Make
sure you pick up the package for your Solaris release.

If you wish to use gcc to build add-on modules for use with the perl
shipped with Solaris, you should use the Solaris::PerlGcc module
which is available from CPAN.  The perl shipped with Solaris
is configured and built with the Sun compilers, and the compiler
configuration information stored in Config.pm is therefore only
relevant to the Sun compilers.  The Solaris:PerlGcc module contains a
replacement Config.pm that is correct for gcc - see the module for
details.

=head3 GNU as and GNU ld

The following information applies to gcc version 2.  Volunteers to
update it as appropriately for gcc version 3 would be appreciated.

The versions of as and ld supplied with Solaris work fine for building
perl.  There is normally no need to install the GNU versions to
compile perl.

If you decide to ignore this advice and use the GNU versions anyway,
then be sure that they are relatively recent.  Versions newer than 2.7
are apparently new enough.  Older versions may have trouble with
dynamic loading.

If you wish to use GNU ld, then you need to pass it the -Wl,-E flag.
The hints/solaris_2.sh file tries to do this automatically by setting
the following Configure variables:

 ccdlflags="$ccdlflags -Wl,-E"
 lddlflags="$lddlflags -Wl,-E -G"

However, over the years, changes in gcc, GNU ld, and Solaris ld have made
it difficult to automatically detect which ld ultimately gets called.
You may have to manually edit config.sh and add the -Wl,-E flags
yourself, or else run Configure interactively and add the flags at the
appropriate prompts.

If your gcc is configured to use GNU as and ld but you want to use the
Solaris ones instead to build perl, then you'll need to add
-B/usr/ccs/bin/ to the gcc command line.  One convenient way to do
that is with

 $ sh Configure -Dcc='gcc -B/usr/ccs/bin/'

Note that the trailing slash is required.  This will result in some
harmless warnings as Configure is run:

 gcc: file path prefix `/usr/ccs/bin/' never used

These messages may safely be ignored.
(Note that for a SunOS4 system, you must use -B/bin/ instead.)

Alternatively, you can use the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX environment variable to
ensure that Sun's as and ld are used.  Consult your gcc documentation
for further information on the -B option and the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX variable.

=head3 Sun and GNU make

The make under /usr/ccs/bin works fine for building perl.  If you
have the Sun C compilers, you will also have a parallel version of
make (dmake).  This works fine to build perl, but can sometimes cause
problems when running 'make test' due to underspecified dependencies
between the different test harness files.  The same problem can also
affect the building of some add-on modules, so in those cases either
specify '-m serial' on the dmake command line, or use
/usr/ccs/bin/make instead.  If you wish to use GNU make, be sure that
the set-group-id bit is not set.  If it is, then arrange your PATH so
that /usr/ccs/bin/make is before GNU make or else have the system
administrator disable the set-group-id bit on GNU make.

=head3 Avoid libucb

Solaris provides some BSD-compatibility functions in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a.
Perl will not build and run correctly if linked against -lucb since it
contains routines that are incompatible with the standard Solaris libc.
Normally this is not a problem since the solaris hints file prevents
Configure from even looking in /usr/ucblib for libraries, and also
explicitly omits -lucb.

=head2 Environment for Compiling perl on Solaris

=head3 PATH

Make sure your PATH includes the compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/ if you're
using Sun's compiler) as well as /usr/ccs/bin/ to pick up the other
development tools (such as make, ar, as, and ld).  Make sure your path
either doesn't include /usr/ucb or that it includes it after the
compiler and compiler tools and other standard Solaris directories.
You definitely don't want /usr/ucb/cc.

=head3 LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set, be sure that
it does NOT include /lib or /usr/lib.  If you will be building
extensions that call third-party shared libraries (e.g. Berkeley DB)
then make sure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes
the directory with that library (e.g. /usr/local/lib).

If you get an error message

 dlopen: stub interception failed

it is probably because your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
includes a directory which is a symlink to /usr/lib (such as /lib).
The reason this causes a problem is quite subtle.  The file
libdl.so.1.0 actually *only* contains functions which generate 'stub
interception failed' errors!  The runtime linker intercepts links to
"/usr/lib/libdl.so.1.0" and links in internal implementations of those
functions instead.  [Thanks to Tim Bunce for this explanation.]

=head1 RUN CONFIGURE

See the INSTALL file for general information regarding Configure.
Only Solaris-specific issues are discussed here.  Usually, the
defaults should be fine.

=head2 64-bit perl on Solaris

See the INSTALL file for general information regarding 64-bit compiles.
In general, the defaults should be fine for most people.

By default, perl-5.6.0 (or later) is compiled as a 32-bit application
with largefile and long-long support.

=head3 General 32-bit vs. 64-bit issues

Solaris 7 and above will run in either 32 bit or 64 bit mode on SPARC
CPUs, via a reboot. You can build 64 bit apps whilst running 32 bit
mode and vice-versa. 32 bit apps will run under Solaris running in
either 32 or 64 bit mode.  64 bit apps require Solaris to be running
64 bit mode.

Existing 32 bit apps are properly known as LP32, i.e. Longs and
Pointers are 32 bit.  64-bit apps are more properly known as LP64.
The discriminating feature of a LP64 bit app is its ability to utilise a
64-bit address space.  It is perfectly possible to have a LP32 bit app
that supports both 64-bit integers (long long) and largefiles (> 2GB),
and this is the default for perl-5.6.0.

For a more complete explanation of 64-bit issues, see the
"Solaris 64-bit Developer's Guide" at L<http://docs.sun.com/>

You can detect the OS mode using "isainfo -v", e.g.

 $ isainfo -v   # Ultra 30 in 64 bit mode
 64-bit sparcv9 applications
 32-bit sparc applications

By default, perl will be compiled as a 32-bit application.  Unless
you want to allocate more than ~ 4GB of memory inside perl, or unless
you need more than 255 open file descriptors, you probably don't need
perl to be a 64-bit app.

=head3 Large File Support

For Solaris 2.6 and onwards, there are two different ways for 32-bit
applications to manipulate large files (files whose size is > 2GByte).
(A 64-bit application automatically has largefile support built in
by default.)

First is the "transitional compilation environment", described in
lfcompile64(5).  According to the man page,

 The transitional compilation  environment  exports  all  the
 explicit 64-bit functions (xxx64()) and types in addition to
 all the regular functions (xxx()) and types. Both xxx()  and
 xxx64()  functions  are  available to the program source.  A
 32-bit application must use the xxx64() functions in  order
 to  access  large  files.  See the lf64(5) manual page for a
 complete listing of the 64-bit transitional interfaces.

The transitional compilation environment is obtained with the
following compiler and linker flags:

 getconf LFS64_CFLAGS        -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
 getconf LFS64_LDFLAG        # nothing special needed
 getconf LFS64_LIBS          # nothing special needed

Second is the "large file compilation environment", described in
lfcompile(5).  According to the man page,

 Each interface named xxx() that needs to access 64-bit entities
 to  access  large  files maps to a xxx64() call in the
 resulting binary. All relevant data types are defined to  be
 of correct size (for example, off_t has a typedef definition
 for a 64-bit entity).

 An application compiled in this environment is able  to  use
 the  xxx()  source interfaces to access both large and small
 files, rather than having to explicitly utilize the  transitional
 xxx64()  interface  calls to access large files.

Two exceptions are fseek() and ftell().  32-bit applications should
use fseeko(3C) and ftello(3C).  These will get automatically mapped
to fseeko64() and ftello64().

The large file compilation environment is obtained with

 getconf LFS_CFLAGS      -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
 getconf LFS_LDFLAGS     # nothing special needed
 getconf LFS_LIBS        # nothing special needed

By default, perl uses the large file compilation environment and
relies on Solaris to do the underlying mapping of interfaces.

=head3 Building an LP64 perl

To compile a 64-bit application on an UltraSparc with a recent Sun Compiler,
you need to use the flag "-xarch=v9".  getconf(1) will tell you this, e.g.

 $ getconf -a | grep v9
 XBS5_LP64_OFF64_CFLAGS:         -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LDFLAGS:        -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LINTFLAGS:      -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_CFLAGS:       -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS:      -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LINTFLAGS:    -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LP64_OFF64_CFLAGS:        -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LDFLAGS:       -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LINTFLAGS:     -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_CFLAGS:      -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS:     -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LINTFLAGS:   -xarch=v9

This flag is supported in Sun WorkShop Compilers 5.0 and onwards
(now marketed under the name Forte) when used on Solaris 7 or later on
UltraSparc systems.

If you are using gcc, you would need to use -mcpu=v9 -m64 instead.  This
option is not yet supported as of gcc 2.95.2; from install/SPECIFIC
in that release:

 GCC version 2.95 is not able to compile code correctly for sparc64
 targets. Users of the Linux kernel, at least, can use the sparc32
 program to start up a new shell invocation with an environment that
 causes configure to recognize (via uname -a) the system as sparc-*-*
 instead.

All this should be handled automatically by the hints file, if
requested.

=head3 Long Doubles

As of 5.8.1, long doubles are working if you use the Sun compilers
(needed for additional math routines not included in libm).

=head2 Threads in perl on Solaris

It is possible to build a threaded version of perl on Solaris.  The entire
perl thread implementation is still experimental, however, so beware.

=head2 Malloc Issues with perl on Solaris

Starting from perl 5.7.1 perl uses the Solaris malloc, since the perl
malloc breaks when dealing with more than 2GB of memory, and the Solaris
malloc also seems to be faster.

If you for some reason (such as binary backward compatibility) really
need to use perl's malloc, you can rebuild perl from the sources
and Configure the build with 

 $ sh Configure -Dusemymalloc

You should not use perl's malloc if you are building with gcc.  There
are reports of core dumps, especially in the PDL module.  The problem
appears to go away under -DDEBUGGING, so it has been difficult to
track down.  Sun's compiler appears to be okay with or without perl's
malloc. [XXX further investigation is needed here.]

=head1 MAKE PROBLEMS

=over 4

=item Dynamic Loading Problems With GNU as and GNU ld

If you have problems with dynamic loading using gcc on SunOS or
Solaris, and you are using GNU as and GNU ld, see the section
L</"GNU as and GNU ld"> above.

=item ld.so.1: ./perl: fatal: relocation error:

If you get this message on SunOS or Solaris, and you're using gcc,
it's probably the GNU as or GNU ld problem in the previous item
L</"GNU as and GNU ld">.

=item dlopen: stub interception failed

The primary cause of the 'dlopen: stub interception failed' message is
that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes a directory
which is a symlink to /usr/lib (such as /lib).  See
L</"LD_LIBRARY_PATH"> above.

=item #error "No DATAMODEL_NATIVE specified"

This is a common error when trying to build perl on Solaris 2.6 with a
gcc installation from Solaris 2.5 or 2.5.1.  The Solaris header files
changed, so you need to update your gcc installation.  You can either
rerun the fixincludes script from gcc or take the opportunity to
update your gcc installation.

=item sh: ar: not found

This is a message from your shell telling you that the command 'ar'
was not found.  You need to check your PATH environment variable to
make sure that it includes the directory with the 'ar' command.  This
is a common problem on Solaris, where 'ar' is in the /usr/ccs/bin/
directory.

=back

=head1 MAKE TEST

=head2 op/stat.t test 4 in Solaris

F<op/stat.t> test 4 may fail if you are on a tmpfs of some sort.
Building in /tmp sometimes shows this behavior.  The
test suite detects if you are building in /tmp, but it may not be able
to catch all tmpfs situations.

=head2 nss_delete core dump from op/pwent or op/grent

See L<perlhpux/"nss_delete core dump from op/pwent or op/grent">.

=head1 CROSS-COMPILATION

Nothing too unusual here.  You can easily do this if you have a 
cross-compiler available;  A usual Configure invocation when targetting a
Solaris x86 looks something like this:

    sh ./Configure -des -Dusecrosscompile \
        -Dcc=i386-pc-solaris2.11-gcc      \
        -Dsysroot=$SYSROOT                \
        -Alddlflags=" -Wl,-z,notext"      \
        -Dtargethost=... # The usual cross-compilation options

The lddlflags addition is the only abnormal bit.

=head1 PREBUILT BINARIES OF PERL FOR SOLARIS

You can pick up prebuilt binaries for Solaris from
L<http://www.sunfreeware.com/>, L<http://www.blastwave.org>,
ActiveState L<http://www.activestate.com/>, and
L<http://www.perl.com/> under the Binaries list at the top of the
page.  There are probably other sources as well.  Please note that
these sites are under the control of their respective owners, not the
perl developers.

=head1 RUNTIME ISSUES FOR PERL ON SOLARIS

=head2 Limits on Numbers of Open Files on Solaris

The stdio(3C) manpage notes that for LP32 applications, only 255
files may be opened using fopen(), and only file descriptors 0
through 255 can be used in a stream.  Since perl calls open() and
then fdopen(3C) with the resulting file descriptor, perl is limited
to 255 simultaneous open files, even if sysopen() is used.  If this
proves to be an insurmountable problem, you can compile perl as a
LP64 application, see L</Building an LP64 perl> for details.  Note
also that the default resource limit for open file descriptors on
Solaris is 255, so you will have to modify your ulimit or rctl
(Solaris 9 onwards) appropriately.

=head1 SOLARIS-SPECIFIC MODULES

See the modules under the Solaris:: and Sun::Solaris namespaces on CPAN,
see L<http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Solaris/> and
L<http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Sun/>.

=head1 SOLARIS-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH MODULES

=head2 Proc::ProcessTable on Solaris

Proc::ProcessTable does not compile on Solaris with perl5.6.0 and higher
if you have LARGEFILES defined.  Since largefile support is the
default in 5.6.0 and later, you have to take special steps to use this
module.

The problem is that various structures visible via procfs use off_t,
and if you compile with largefile support these change from 32 bits to
64 bits.  Thus what you get back from procfs doesn't match up with
the structures in perl, resulting in garbage.  See proc(4) for further
discussion.

A fix for Proc::ProcessTable is to edit Makefile to
explicitly remove the largefile flags from the ones MakeMaker picks up
from Config.pm.  This will result in Proc::ProcessTable being built
under the correct environment.  Everything should then be OK as long as
Proc::ProcessTable doesn't try to share off_t's with the rest of perl,
or if it does they should be explicitly specified as off64_t.

=head2 BSD::Resource on Solaris

BSD::Resource versions earlier than 1.09 do not compile on Solaris
with perl 5.6.0 and higher, for the same reasons as Proc::ProcessTable.
BSD::Resource versions starting from 1.09 have a workaround for the problem.

=head2 Net::SSLeay on Solaris

Net::SSLeay requires a /dev/urandom to be present. This device is
available from Solaris 9 onwards.  For earlier Solaris versions you
can either get the package SUNWski (packaged with several Sun
software products, for example the Sun WebServer, which is part of
the Solaris Server Intranet Extension, or the Sun Directory Services,
part of Solaris for ISPs) or download the ANDIrand package from
L<http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~andi/>. If you use SUNWski, make a
symbolic link /dev/urandom pointing to /dev/random.  For more details,
see Document ID27606 entitled "Differing /dev/random support requirements
within Solaris[TM] Operating Environments", available at
L<http://sunsolve.sun.com> .

It may be possible to use the Entropy Gathering Daemon (written in
Perl!), available from L<http://www.lothar.com/tech/crypto/>.

=head1 SunOS 4.x

In SunOS 4.x you most probably want to use the SunOS ld, /usr/bin/ld,
since the more recent versions of GNU ld (like 2.13) do not seem to
work for building Perl anymore.  When linking the extensions, the
GNU ld gets very unhappy and spews a lot of errors like this

  ... relocation truncated to fit: BASE13 ...

and dies.  Therefore the SunOS 4.1 hints file explicitly sets the
ld to be F</usr/bin/ld>.

As of Perl 5.8.1 the dynamic loading of libraries (DynaLoader, XSLoader)
also seems to have become broken in in SunOS 4.x.  Therefore the default
is to build Perl statically.

Running the test suite in SunOS 4.1 is a bit tricky since the
F<dist/Tie-File/t/09_gen_rs.t> test hangs (subtest #51, FWIW) for some
unknown reason.  Just stop the test and kill that particular Perl
process.

There are various other failures, that as of SunOS 4.1.4 and gcc 3.2.2
look a lot like gcc bugs.  Many of the failures happen in the Encode
tests, where for example when the test expects "0" you get "&#48;"
which should after a little squinting look very odd indeed.
Another example is earlier in F<t/run/fresh_perl> where chr(0xff) is
expected but the test fails because the result is chr(0xff).  Exactly.

This is the "make test" result from the said combination:

  Failed 27 test scripts out of 745, 96.38% okay.

Running the C<harness> is painful because of the many failing
Unicode-related tests will output megabytes of failure messages,
but if one patiently waits, one gets these results:

The alarm() test failure is caused by system() apparently blocking

has been end-of-lifed years ago, don't hold your breath for a fix.
In addition to that, don't try anything too Unicode-y, especially
with Encode, and you should be fine in SunOS 4.x.

=head1 NAME

perlsource - A guide to the Perl source tree

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the layout of the Perl source tree. If you're
hacking on the Perl core, this will help you find what you're looking
for.

=head1 FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND

The Perl source tree is big. Here's some of the thing you'll find in
it:

=head2 C code

The C source code and header files mostly live in the root of the
source tree. There are a few platform-specific directories which
contain C code. In addition, some of the modules shipped with Perl
include C or XS code.

See L<perlinterp> for more details on the files that make up the Perl
interpreter, as well as details on how it works.

=head2 Core modules

Modules shipped as part of the Perl core live in four subdirectories.
Two of these directories contain modules that live in the core, and two
contain modules that can also be released separately on CPAN. Modules
which can be released on cpan are known as "dual-life" modules.

=over 4

=item * F<lib/>

This directory contains pure-Perl modules which are only released as
part of the core. This directory contains I<all> of the modules and
their tests, unlike other core modules.

=item * F<ext/>

Like F<lib/>, this directory contains modules which are only released
as part of the core.  Unlike F<lib/>, however, a module under F<ext/>
generally has a CPAN-style directory- and file-layout and its own
F<Makefile.PL>.  There is no expectation that a module under F<ext/>
will work with earlier versions of Perl 5.  Hence, such a module may
take full advantage of syntactical and other improvements in Perl 5
blead.

=item * F<dist/>

This directory is for dual-life modules where the blead source is
canonical. Note that some modules in this directory may not yet have
been released separately on CPAN.  Modules under F<dist/> should make
an effort to work with earlier versions of Perl 5.

=item * F<cpan/>

This directory contains dual-life modules where the CPAN module is
canonical. Do not patch these modules directly! Changes to these
modules should be submitted to the maintainer of the CPAN module. Once
those changes are applied and released, the new version of the module
will be incorporated into the core.

=back

For some dual-life modules, it has not yet been determined if the CPAN
version or the blead source is canonical. Until that is done, those
modules should be in F<cpan/>.

=head2 Tests

The Perl core has an extensive test suite. If you add new tests (or new
modules with tests), you may need to update the F<t/TEST> file so that
the tests are run.

=over 4

=item * Module tests

Tests for core modules in the F<lib/> directory are right next to the
module itself. For example, we have F<lib/strict.pm> and
F<lib/strict.t>.

Tests for modules in F<ext/> and the dual-life modules are in F<t/>
subdirectories for each module, like a standard CPAN distribution.

=item * F<t/base/>

Tests for the absolute basic functionality of Perl. This includes
C<if>, basic file reads and writes, simple regexes, etc. These are run
first in the test suite and if any of them fail, something is I<really>
broken.

=item * F<t/cmd/>

Tests for basic control structures, C<if>/C<else>, C<while>, subroutines,
etc.

=item * F<t/comp/>

Tests for basic issues of how Perl parses and compiles itself.

=item * F<t/io/>

Tests for built-in IO functions, including command line arguments.

=item * F<t/mro/>

Tests for perl's method resolution order implementations (see L<mro>).

=item * F<t/op/>

Tests for perl's built in functions that don't fit into any of the
other directories.

=item * F<t/opbasic/>

Tests for perl's built in functions which, like those in F<t/op/>, do
not fit into any of the other directories, but which, in addition,
cannot use F<t/test.pl>,as that program depends on functionality which
the test file itself is testing.

=item * F<t/re/>

Tests for regex related functions or behaviour. (These used to live in
t/op).

=item * F<t/run/>

Tests for features of how perl actually runs, including exit codes and
handling of PERL* environment variables.

=item * F<t/uni/>

Tests for the core support of Unicode.

=item * F<t/win32/>

Windows-specific tests.

=item * F<t/porting/>

Tests the state of the source tree for various common errors. For
example, it tests that everyone who is listed in the git log has a
corresponding entry in the F<AUTHORS> file.

=item * F<t/lib/>

The old home for the module tests, you shouldn't put anything new in
here. There are still some bits and pieces hanging around in here that
need to be moved. Perhaps you could move them?  Thanks!

=back

=head2 Documentation

All of the core documentation intended for end users lives in F<pod/>.
Individual modules in F<lib/>, F<ext/>, F<dist/>, and F<cpan/> usually
have their own documentation, either in the F<Module.pm> file or an
accompanying F<Module.pod> file.

Finally, documentation intended for core Perl developers lives in the
F<Porting/> directory.

=head2 Hacking tools and documentation

The F<Porting> directory contains a grab bag of code and documentation
intended to help porters work on Perl. Some of the highlights include:

=over 4

=item * F<check*>

These are scripts which will check the source things like ANSI C
violations, POD encoding issues, etc.

=item * F<Maintainers>, F<Maintainers.pl>, and F<Maintainers.pm>

These files contain information on who maintains which modules. Run
C<perl Porting/Maintainers -M Module::Name> to find out more
information about a dual-life module.

=item * F<podtidy>

Tidies a pod file. It's a good idea to run this on a pod file you've
patched.

=back

=head2 Build system

The Perl build system on *nix-like systems starts with the F<Configure>
script in the root directory.

Platform-specific pieces of the build system also live in
platform-specific directories like F<win32/>, F<vms/>, etc.
Windows and VMS have their own Configure-like scripts, in their
respective directories.

The F<Configure> script (or a platform-specific similar script) is
ultimately responsible for generating a F<Makefile> from F<Makefile.SH>.

The build system that Perl uses is called metaconfig. This system is
maintained separately from the Perl core, and knows about the
platform-specific Configure-like scripts, as well as F<Configure>
itself.

The metaconfig system has its own git repository. Please see its README
file in L<https://github.com/Perl/metaconfig> for more details.

The F<Cross> directory contains various files related to
cross-compiling Perl. See F<Cross/README> for more details.

=head2 F<AUTHORS>

This file lists everyone who's contributed to Perl. If you submit a
patch, you should add your name to this file as part of the patch.

=head2 F<MANIFEST>

The F<MANIFEST> file in the root of the source tree contains a list of
every file in the Perl core, as well as a brief description of each
file.

You can get an overview of all the files with this command:

  % perl -lne 'print if /^[^\/]+\.[ch]\s+/' MANIFEST

perlstyle - Perl style guide

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each programmer will, of course, have his or her own preferences in
regards to formatting, but there are some general guidelines that will
make your programs easier to read, understand, and maintain.

The most important thing is to use L<strict> and L<warnings> in all your
code or know the reason why not to.  You may turn them off explicitly for
particular portions of code via C<no warnings> or C<no strict>, and this
can be limited to the specific warnings or strict features you wish to
disable.  The B<-w> flag and C<$^W> variable should not be used for this
purpose since they can affect code you use but did not write, such as
modules from core or CPAN.

A concise way to arrange for this is to use the
L<C<use VERSION>|perlfunc/use VERSION> syntax, requesting a version 5.36
or above, which will enable both the C<strict> and C<warnings> pragmata (as
well as several other useful L<named features|feature/AVAILABLE FEATURES>).

    use v5.36;

Regarding aesthetics of code layout, about the only thing Larry
cares strongly about is that the closing curly bracket of
a multi-line BLOCK should line up with the keyword that started the construct.
Beyond that, he has other preferences that aren't so strong:

=over 4

=item *

4-column indent.

=item *

Opening curly on same line as keyword, if possible, otherwise line up.

=item *

Space before the opening curly of a multi-line BLOCK.

=item *

One-line BLOCK may be put on one line, including curlies.

=item *

No space before the semicolon.

=item *

Semicolon omitted in "short" one-line BLOCK.

=item *

Space around most operators.

=item *

Space around a "complex" subscript (inside brackets).

=item *

Blank lines between chunks that do different things.

=item *

Uncuddled elses.

=item *

No space between function name and its opening parenthesis.

=item *

Space after each comma.

=item *

Long lines broken after an operator (except C<and> and C<or>).

=item *

Space after last parenthesis matching on current line.

=item *

Line up corresponding items vertically.

=item *

Omit redundant punctuation as long as clarity doesn't suffer.

=back

Larry has his reasons for each of these things, but he doesn't claim that
everyone else's mind works the same as his does.

Here are some other more substantive style issues to think about:

=over 4

=item *

Just because you I<CAN> do something a particular way doesn't mean that
you I<SHOULD> do it that way.  Perl is designed to give you several
ways to do anything, so consider picking the most readable one.  For
instance

    open(my $fh, '<', $foo) || die "Can't open $foo: $!";

is better than

    die "Can't open $foo: $!" unless open(my $fh, '<', $foo);

because the second way hides the main point of the statement in a
modifier.  On the other hand

    print "Starting analysis\n" if $verbose;

is better than

    $verbose && print "Starting analysis\n";

because the main point isn't whether the user typed B<-v> or not.

Similarly, just because an operator lets you assume default arguments
doesn't mean that you have to make use of the defaults.  The defaults
are there for lazy systems programmers writing one-shot programs.  If
you want your program to be readable, consider supplying the argument.

Along the same lines, just because you I<CAN> omit parentheses in many
places doesn't mean that you ought to:

    return print reverse sort num values %array;
    return print(reverse(sort num (values(%array))));

When in doubt, parenthesize.  At the very least it will let some poor
schmuck bounce on the % key in B<vi>.

Even if you aren't in doubt, consider the mental welfare of the person
who has to maintain the code after you, and who will probably put
parentheses in the wrong place.

=item *

Don't go through silly contortions to exit a loop at the top or the
bottom, when Perl provides the C<last> operator so you can exit in
the middle.  Just "outdent" it a little to make it more visible:

    LINE:
	for (;;) {
	    statements;
	  last LINE if $foo;
	    next LINE if /^#/;
	    statements;
	}

=item *

Don't be afraid to use loop labels--they're there to enhance
readability as well as to allow multilevel loop breaks.  See the
previous example.

=item *

Avoid using C<grep()> (or C<map()>) or `backticks` in a void context, that is,
when you just throw away their return values.  Those functions all
have return values, so use them.  Otherwise use a C<foreach()> loop or
the C<system()> function instead.

=item *

For portability, when using features that may not be implemented on
every machine, test the construct in an eval to see if it fails.  If
you know what version or patchlevel a particular feature was
implemented, you can test C<$]> (C<$PERL_VERSION> in C<English>) to see if it
will be there.  The C<Config> module will also let you interrogate values
determined by the B<Configure> program when Perl was installed.

=item *

Choose mnemonic identifiers.  If you can't remember what mnemonic means,
you've got a problem.

=item *

While short identifiers like C<$gotit> are probably ok, use underscores to
separate words in longer identifiers.  It is generally easier to read
C<$var_names_like_this> than C<$VarNamesLikeThis>, especially for
non-native speakers of English. It's also a simple rule that works
consistently with C<VAR_NAMES_LIKE_THIS>.

Package names are sometimes an exception to this rule.  Perl informally
reserves lowercase module names for "pragma" modules like C<integer> and
C<strict>.  Other modules should begin with a capital letter and use mixed
case, but probably without underscores due to limitations in primitive
file systems' representations of module names as files that must fit into a
few sparse bytes.

=item *

You may find it helpful to use letter case to indicate the scope
or nature of a variable. For example:

    $ALL_CAPS_HERE   constants only (beware clashes with perl vars!)
    $Some_Caps_Here  package-wide global/static
    $no_caps_here    function scope my() or local() variables

Function and method names seem to work best as all lowercase.
E.g., C<$obj-E<gt>as_string()>.

You can use a leading underscore to indicate that a variable or
function should not be used outside the package that defined it.

=item *

If you have a really hairy regular expression, use the C</x>  or C</xx>
modifiers and put in some whitespace to make it look a little less like
line noise.
Don't use slash as a delimiter when your regexp has slashes or backslashes.

=item *

Use the C<and> and C<or> operators to avoid having to parenthesize
list operators so much, and to reduce the incidence of punctuation
