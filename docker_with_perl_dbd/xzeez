It is outside the scope of this document to go through all of the
possible TAF situations you might want to set up but here is a simple
example:

The TNS entry for the instance has had the following added to the
CONNECT_DATA section

   (FAILOVER_MODE=
               (TYPE=select)
               (METHOD=basic)
               (RETRIES=10)
               (DELAY=10))

You will also have to create your own perl function that will be
called from the client.  You can name it anything you want and it will
always be passed two parameters, the failover event value and the
failover type.  You can also set a sleep value in case of failover
error and the OCI client will sleep for the specified seconds before it
attempts another event.

  use DBD::Oracle(qw(:ora_fail_over));
  #import the ora fail over constants

  #set up TAF on the connection
  # NOTE since DBD::Oracle uses call_pv you may need to pass a full
  # name space as the function e.g., 'main::handle_taf'
  # NOTE from 1.49_00 ora_taf_function can accept a code ref as well
  #      as a sub name as it now uses call_sv
  my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:Oracle:XE', 'hr', 'hr',
                         {ora_taf_function => 'main::handle_taf'});

  #create the perl TAF event function

  sub handle_taf {
    # NOTE from 1.49_00 the $dbh handle was passed to your callback
    my ($fo_event,$fo_type, $dbh) = @_;
    if ($fo_event == OCI_FO_BEGIN){

      print " Instance Unavailable Please stand by!! \n";
      printf(" Your TAF type is %s \n",
                       (($fo_type==OCI_FO_NONE) ? "NONE"
                       :($fo_type==OCI_FO_SESSION) ? "SESSION"
                       :($fo_type==OCI_FO_SELECT) ? "SELECT"
                       : "UNKNOWN!"));
    }
    elsif ($fo_event == OCI_FO_ABORT){
       print " Failover aborted. Failover will not take place.\n";
    }
    elsif ($fo_event == OCI_FO_END){
       printf(" Failover ended ...Resuming your %s\n",(($fo_type==OCI_FO_NONE) ? "NONE"
                                                      :($fo_type==OCI_FO_SESSION) ? "SESSION"
                                                      :($fo_type==OCI_FO_SELECT) ? "SELECT"
                                                      : "UNKNOWN!"));
    }
    elsif ($fo_event == OCI_FO_REAUTH){
       print " Failed over user. Resuming services\n";
    }
    elsif ($fo_event == OCI_FO_ERROR){
       print " Failover error ...\n";
       sleep 5;                 # sleep before having another go
       return OCI_FO_RETRY;
    }
    else {
       printf(" Bad Failover Event: %d.\n",  $fo_event);

    }
    return 0;
  }

The TAF types are as follows

  OCI_FO_SESSION indicates the user has requested only session failover.
  OCI_FO_SELECT indicates the user has requested select failover.
  OCI_FO_NONE indicates the user has not requested a failover type.
  OCI_FO_TXNAL indicates the user has requested a transaction failover.

The TAF events are as follows

  OCI_FO_BEGIN indicates that failover has detected a lost connection and failover is starting.
  OCI_FO_END   indicates successful completion of failover.
  OCI_FO_ABORT indicates that failover was unsuccessful, and there is no option of retrying.
  OCI_FO_ERROR also indicates that failover was unsuccessful, but it gives the application the opportunity to handle the error and retry failover.
  OCI_FO_REAUTH indicates that you have multiple authentication handles and failover has occurred after the original authentication. It indicates that a user handle has been re-authenticated. To find out which, the application checks the OCI_ATTR_SESSION attribute of the service context handle (which is the first parameter).

=head3 Connect Attributes

=head4 ora_ncs_buff_mtpl

You can customize the size of the buffer when selecting LOBs with
the built-in AUTO Lob.  The default value is 4 which is probably
excessive for most situations but is needed for backward
compatibility.  If you not converting between a NCS on the DB and the
Client then you might want to set this to 1 to reduce memory usage.

This value can also be specified with the C<ORA_DBD_NCS_BUFFER>
environment variable in which case it sets the value at the connect
stage.

=head4 ora_drcp

For Oracle 11.2 or greater.

Set to I<1> to enable DRCP. Can also be set via the C<ORA_DRCP> environment variable.

Note, this really enables Session pools on Client side. Each pool is identified
by DB, user, charsets and pool mode. The latter one can be affected by
B<ora_events>. Sessions are kept open after disconnect, so next connect may
pick up session that was previously used. That means that any "alter session"
changes can be still in effect. One may use B<ora_drcp_tag> to mark such sessions.

Of course this allows saving resources and speeding up connecting. This also works
across thread-boundaries, unlike connect_cached. So, if there are multiple threads
that constantly connect and disconnect, then this option is the best solution.
It may even work in situations of single thread where libraries have to obtain connection
only for short operation and then release it.

The feature can be combined with actual configuring of DRCP on the Server side.
Then connecting to ':pooled' DNS shall also optimize use of resources on the Server
side, since this enables sharing of server sessions between client sessions.

=head4 ora_drcp_class

If you are using DRCP, you can set a CONNECTION_CLASS for your pools
as well. OCI will ensure that connections belonging to a 'class' are
not shared outside the class'.

The values for ora_drcp_class cannot contain a '*' and must be less
than 1024 characters.

This value can be also be specified with the C<ORA_DRCP_CLASS>
environment variable.

Note that a connection class must be specified in order to enable
inter-process sharing of Server side sessions (:pooled connections)

=head4 ora_drcp_min

This optional value specifies the minimum number of sessions that are
initially allocated for the application process.  New sessions are only
allocated after this value has been reached.

The default value is 0 and any value greater than or equal to 0 is valid.

For multi-process applications, it is recommended to leave the value at 0.
This ensures that each process is only occupying a server session while
the process is doing database work.

For multi-threaded applications, the value could be set to the number of
concurrent statements the application is planning or expecting to run.
Please note that DRCP has not been tested with multi-threading.

This value can also be specified with the C<ORA_DRCP_MIN> environment
variable.

=head4 ora_drcp_max

This optional value specifies the maximum number of sessions that can
be open at one time.  Once reached no more sessions can be opened
until one becomes free. The default value is 40 and any value above 0
is valid.  You should not set this value lower than ora_drcp_min as
that will just waste resources.

This value can also be specified with the C<ORA_DRCP_MAX> environment
variable.

=head4 ora_drcp_incr

This optional value specifies the next increment for sessions to be
started if the current number of sessions are less than
ora_drcp_max. The default value is 1 and any value above 0 is
valid as long as the value of ora_drcp_min + ora_drcp_incr is not
greater than ora_drcp_max.

This value can also be specified with the C<ORA_DRCP_INCR> environment
variable.

=head4 ora_drcp_mode

By default, when count of open session reaches ora_drcp_max, the call to
connect shall block untill some session becomes free. One can change it
by setting this attribute to one of OCI_SPOOL_ATTRVAL_NOWAIT,
OCI_SPOOL_ATTRVAL_FORCEGET, OCI_SPOOL_ATTRVAL_TIMEDWAIT. The latter one
needs time in milliseconds, which is passed using attribute ora_drcp_wait.
Default value is OCI_SPOOL_ATTRVAL_WAIT. These contants can be imported
from DBD::Oracle. Important, functionality with OCI_SPOOL_ATTRVAL_TIMEDWAIT
and OCI_SPOOL_ATTRVAL_NOWAIT was added by Oracle somewhere after version
12, so to make it safe, DBD::Oracle supports it when compiled against
OCI with Version > 18

=head4 ora_drcp_tag

This is similar to ora_drcp_class, but it is not so strict. If session
with given tag does not exist, then another session is returned, One can
check tag of that session after connection. The tag can be changed by changing
this attribute. But change happens only at "disconnect".

=head4 ora_drcp_rlb

This optional value controls whether run-time connection load balancing
is used for Oracle RAC. The default value is 0, which disables the feature.
Set the value to 1 to enable the feature.

This value can also be specified with the C<ORA_DRCP_RLB> environment
variable.

=head4 ora_taf

This attribute was removed in 1.49_00 as it was redundant. To
enable TAF simply set L</ora_taf_function>.

=head4 ora_taf_function

If your Oracle instance has been configured to use TAF events you can
enable the TAF callback by setting this option.

The name of the Perl subroutine (or a code ref from 1.49_00) that will
be called from OCI when a TAF event occurs. You must supply a perl
function to use the callback and it will always receive at least two
parameters; the failover event value and the failover type. From
1.49_00 the dbh is passed as the third argument. Below is an example
of a TAF function

  sub taf_event{
     # NOTE from 1.49_00 the $dbh handle is passed to the callback
     my ($event, $type, $dbh) = @_;

     print "My TAF event=$event\n";
     print "My TAF type=$type\n";
     return;
  }

Note if passing a sub name you will probably have to use the full name
space when setting the TAF function e.g., 'main::my_taf_function' and
not just 'my_taf_function'.

=head4 ora_taf_sleep

This attribute was removed in 1.49_00 as it was redundant. If you want
to sleep between retries simple add a sleep to your callback sub.

=head4 ora_session_mode

The ora_session_mode attribute can be used to connect with SYSDBA,
SYSOPER, ORA_SYSASM, ORA_SYSBACKUP, ORA_SYSKM and ORA_SYSDG authorization.
The ORA_SYSDBA, ORA_SYSOPER, ORA_SYSASM, ORA_SYSBACKUP, ORA_SYSKM
and ORA_SYSDG constants can be imported using

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_session_modes);

This is one case where setting ORACLE_SID may be useful since
connecting as SYSDBA or SYSOPER via SQL*Net is frequently disabled
for security reasons.

Example:

  $dsn = "dbi:Oracle:";       # no dbname here
  $ENV{ORACLE_SID} = "orcl";  # set ORACLE_SID as needed
  delete $ENV{TWO_TASK};      # make sure TWO_TASK isn't set

  $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, "", "", { ora_session_mode => ORA_SYSDBA });

It has been reported that this only works if C<$dsn> does not contain
a SID so that Oracle then uses the value of ORACLE_SID (not
TWO_TASK) environment variable to connect to a local instance. Also
the username and password should be empty, and the user executing the
script needs to be part of the dba group or osdba group.

Note that this does not work with DRCP.

=head4 ora_oratab_orahome

Passing a true value for the ora_oratab_orahome attribute will make
DBD::Oracle change C<$ENV{ORACLE_HOME}> to make the Oracle home directory
that specified in the C</etc/oratab> file I<if> the database to connect to
is specified as a SID that exists in the oratab file, and DBD::Oracle was
built to use the Oracle 7 OCI API (not Oracle 8+).

=head4 ora_module_name

After connecting to the database the value of this attribute is passed
to the SET_MODULE() function in the C<DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO> PL/SQL
package. This can be used to identify the application to the DBA for
monitoring and performance tuning purposes. For example:

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_module_name => $0 });

  $dbh->{ora_module_name} = $y;

The maximum size is 48 bytes.

NOTE: You will need an Oracle client 10.1 or later to use this.

=head4 ora_driver_name

For 11g and later you can now set the name of the driver layer using OCI.
Perl, Perl5, ApachePerl so on. Names starting with "ORA" are reserved. You
can enter up to 8 characters.  If none is enter then this will default to
DBDOxxxx where xxxx is the current version number. This value can be
retrieved on the server side using V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO or
GV$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_driver_name => 'ModPerl_1' });

  $dbh->{ora_driver_name} = $q;

=head4 ora_client_info

Allows you to add any value (up to 64 bytes) to your session and it can be
retrieved on the server side from the C<V$SESSION>a view.

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_client_info => 'Remote2' });

  $dbh->{ora_client_info} = "Remote2";

NOTE: You will need an Oracle client 10.1 or later to use this.

=head4 ora_client_identifier

Allows you to specify the user identifier in the session handle.

Most useful for web applications as it can pass in the session user
name which might be different to the connection user name. Can be up
to 64 bytes long but do not to include the password for security
reasons and the first character of the identifier should not be
':'. This value can be retrieved on the server side using C<V$SESSION>
view.

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_client_identifier => $some_web_user });

  $dbh->{ora_client_identifier} = $local_user;

=head4 ora_action

Allows you to specify any string up to 32 bytes which may be retrieved
on the server side using C<V$SESSION> view.

   my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_action => "Login"});

   $dbh->{ora_action} = "New Long Query 22";

NOTE: You will need an Oracle client 10.1 or later to use this.

=head4 ora_dbh_share

Requires at least Perl 5.8.0 compiled with ithreads (interpreter-based
threads).

Allows you to share database connections between threads. The first
connect will make the connection, all following calls to connect with
the same ora_dbh_share attribute will use the same database connection.
The value must be a reference to a already shared scalar which is
initialized to an empty string.

  our $orashr : shared = '' ;

  $dbh = DBI->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd, {ora_dbh_share => \$orashr}) ;

After shared connection is not needed any more, one should call

  DBD::Oracle::ora_shared_release($orashr);

This shall close shared connection. The function can be imported into
current namespace (use DBD::Oracle qw/ora_shared_release/)

Please keep in mind, this functionality is rather dangerous. One should not
use single connection in multiple threads at the same time, since access to server
is not atomic. There can be problems with transactions or fetching of rows.
It is much better to use sessions-pooling activated with B<ora_drcp>.

=head4 ora_events

Set this attribute to C<1> to enable Oracle Fast Application Notification
(FAN) in a new OCI environment. Can also be set via the C<ORA_EVENTS>
environment variable.

=head4 ora_charset, ora_ncharset

For oracle versions >= 9.2 you can specify the client charset and
ncharset with the ora_charset and ora_ncharset attributes.

These attributes override the settings from environment variables.

  $dbh = DBI->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd,
                       {ora_charset => 'AL32UTF8'});

=head4 ora_verbose

Use this value to enable DBD::Oracle only tracing.  Simply either set
the ora_verbose attribute on the connect() method to the trace level
you desire like this

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, "", "", {ora_verbose=>6});

or set it directly on the DB handle like this;

  $dbh->{ora_verbose} =6;

In both cases the DBD::Oracle trace level is set to 6, which is the highest
level tracing most of the calls to OCI.

NOTE: In future versions of DBD::Oracle ora_verbose will be changed so
that it is simply a switch to turn DBI's DBD tracing on or off.  A
true value will turn it on and a false value will turn it off.  DBI's
"DBD" tracing was not available when ora_verbose was created and
ora_verbose adds an additional test to every trace test.

=head4 ora_oci_success_warn

Use this value to print otherwise silent OCI warnings that may happen
when an execute or fetch returns "Success With Info" or when you want
to tune RowCaching and LOB Reads

  $dbh->{ora_oci_success_warn} = 1;

=head4 ora_objects

Use this value to enable extended embedded oracle objects mode. In extended:

=over 4

=item 1

Embedded objects are returned as <DBD::Oracle::Object> instance (including type-name etc.) instead of simple ARRAY.

=item 2

Determine object type for each instance. All object attributes are returned (not only super-type's attributes).

=back

  $dbh->{ora_objects} = 1;

=head4 ora_ph_type

The default placeholder datatype for the database session.
The C<TYPE> or L</ora_type> attributes to L<DBI/bind_param> and
L<DBI/bind_param_inout> override the datatype for individual placeholders.
The most frequent reason for using this attribute is to permit trailing spaces
in values passed by placeholders.

Constants for the values allowed for this attribute can be imported using

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

Only the following values are permitted for this attribute.

=over 4

=item ORA_VARCHAR2

Oracle clients using OCI 8 will strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \0 bytes.
Oracle clients using OCI 9.2 do not strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \0 bytes.
This is the normal default placeholder type.

=item ORA_STRING

Do not strip trailing spaces and end the string at the first \0.

=item ORA_CHAR

Do not strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \0.
Force 'blank-padded comparison semantics'.

For example:

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

  $SQL="select username from all_users where username = ?";
  #username is a char(8)
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL)";
  $sth->bind_param(1,'bloggs',{ ora_type => ORA_CHAR});

Will pad bloggs out to 8 characters and return the username.

=back

=head4 ora_parse_error_offset

If the previous error was from a failed C<prepare> due to a syntax error,
this attribute gives the offset into the C<Statement> attribute where the
error was found.

=head4 ora_array_chunk_size

Due to OCI limitations, DBD::Oracle needs to buffer up rows of
bind values in its C<execute_for_fetch> implementation. This attribute
sets the number of rows to buffer at a time (default value is 1000).

The C<execute_for_fetch> function will collect (at most) this many
rows in an array, send them off to the DB for execution, then go back
to collect the next chunk of rows and so on. This attribute can be
used to limit or extend the number of rows processed at a time.

Note that this attribute also applies to C<execute_array>, since that
method is implemented using C<execute_for_fetch>.

=head4 ora_connect_with_default_signals

Sometimes the Oracle client seems to change some of the signal
handlers of the process during the connect phase.  For instance, some
users have observed Perl's default C<$SIG{INT}> handler being ignored
after connecting to an Oracle database.  If this causes problems in
your application, set this attribute to an array reference of signals
you would like to be localized during the connect process.  Once the
connect is complete, the signal handlers should be returned to their
previous state.

For example:

  $dbh = DBI->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd,
                       {ora_connect_with_default_signals => [ 'INT' ] });

NOTE disabling the signal handlers the OCI library sets up may affect
functionality in the OCI library.

NOTE If you are using connect_cached then the above example will lead
to DBI thinking each connection is different as an anonymous array reference
is being used. To avoid this when using connect_cached you are advised
to use:

  my @ora_default_signals = (...);
  $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd,
      {ora_connect_with_default_signals => \@ora_default_signals});

In more recent Perl versions you could possibly make use of new state
variables.

=head2 B<connect_cached>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.
Please note that connect_cached has not been tested with DRCP.

=head2 B<data_sources>

  @data_sources = DBI->data_sources('Oracle');
  @data_sources = $dbh->data_sources();

Returns a list of available databases. You will have to set either the 'ORACLE_HOME' or
'TNS_ADMIN' environment value to retrieve this list.  It will read these values from
TNSNAMES.ORA file entries.

=head1 METHODS COMMON TO ALL HANDLES

For all of the methods below, B<$h> can be either a database handle (B<$dbh>)
or a statement handle (B<$sth>). Note that I<$dbh> and I<$sth> can be replaced with
any variable name you choose: these are just the names most often used. Another
common variable used in this documentation is $I<rv>, which stands for "return value".

=head2 B<err>

  $rv = $h->err;

Returns the error code from the last method called.

=head2 B<errstr>

  $str = $h->errstr;

Returns the last error that was reported by Oracle. Starting with "ORA-00000" code followed by the error message.

=head2 B<state>

  $str = $h->state;

Oracle hasn't supported SQLSTATE since the early versions OCI. It will return empty when the command succeeds and
'S1000' (General Error) for all other errors.

While this method can be called as either C<< $sth->state >> or C<< $dbh->state >>, it
is usually clearer to always use C<< $dbh->state >>.

=head2 B<trace>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<trace_msg>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<parse_trace_flag> and B<parse_trace_flags>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<func>

DBD::Oracle uses the C<func> method to support a variety of functions.

=head2 B<Private database handle functions>

Some of these functions are called through the method func()
which is described in the DBI documentation. Any function that begins with ora_
can be called directly.

=head2 B<plsql_errstr>

This function returns a string which describes the errors
from the most recent PL/SQL function, procedure, package,
or package body compile in a format similar to the output
of the SQL*Plus command 'show errors'.

The function returns undef if the error string could not
be retrieved due to a database error.
Look in $dbh->errstr for the cause of the failure.

If there are no compile errors, an empty string is returned.

Example:

    # Show the errors if CREATE PROCEDURE fails
    $dbh->{RaiseError} = 0;
    if ( $dbh->do( q{
        CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE perl_dbd_oracle_test as
        BEGIN
            PROCEDURE filltab( stuff OUT TAB ); asdf
        END; } ) ) {} # Statement succeeded
    }
    elsif ( 6550 != $dbh->err ) { die $dbh->errstr; } # Utter failure
    else {
        my $msg = $dbh->func( 'plsql_errstr' );
        die $dbh->errstr if ! defined $msg;
        die $msg if $msg;
    }

=head2 B<dbms_output_enable / dbms_output_put / dbms_output_get>

These functions use the PL/SQL DBMS_OUTPUT package to store and
retrieve text using the DBMS_OUTPUT buffer.  Text stored in this buffer
by dbms_output_put or any PL/SQL block can be retrieved by
dbms_output_get or any PL/SQL block connected to the same database
session.

Stored text is not available until after dbms_output_put or the PL/SQL
block that saved it completes its execution.  This means you B<CAN NOT>
use these functions to monitor long running PL/SQL procedures.

Example 1:

  # Enable DBMS_OUTPUT and set the buffer size
  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
  $dbh->func( 1000000, 'dbms_output_enable' );

  # Put text in the buffer . . .
  $dbh->func( @text, 'dbms_output_put' );

  # . . . and retrieve it later
  @text = $dbh->func( 'dbms_output_get' );

Example 2:

  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
  $sth = $dbh->prepare(q{
    DECLARE tmp VARCHAR2(50);
    BEGIN
      SELECT SYSDATE INTO tmp FROM DUAL;
      dbms_output.put_line('The date is '||tmp);
    END;
  });
  $sth->execute;

  # retrieve the string
  $date_string = $dbh->func( 'dbms_output_get' );

=head2 B<dbms_output_enable ( [ buffer_size ] )>

This function calls DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE to enable calls to package
DBMS_OUTPUT procedures GET, GET_LINE, PUT, and PUT_LINE.  Calls to
these procedures are ignored unless DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE is called
first.

The buffer_size is the maximum amount of text that can be saved in the
buffer and must be between 2000 and 1,000,000.  If buffer_size is not
given, the default is 20,000 bytes.

=head2 B<dbms_output_put ( [ @lines ] )>

This function calls DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE to add lines to the buffer.

If all lines were saved successfully the function returns 1.  Depending
on the context, an empty list or undef is returned for failure.

If any line causes buffer_size to be exceeded, a buffer overflow error
is raised and the function call fails.  Some of the text might be in
the buffer.

=head2 B<dbms_output_get>

This function calls DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE to retrieve lines of text from
the buffer.

In an array context, all complete lines are removed from the buffer and
returned as a list.  If there are no complete lines, an empty list is
returned.

In a scalar context, the first complete line is removed from the buffer
and returned.  If there are no complete lines, undef is returned.

Any text in the buffer after a call to DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE or
DBMS_OUTPUT.GET is discarded by the next call to DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE,
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT, or DBMS_OUTPUT.NEW_LINE.

=head2 B<reauthenticate ( $username, $password )>

Starts a new session against the current database using the credentials
supplied. Note that this does not work with DRCP.

=head2 B<private_attribute_info>

  $hashref = $dbh->private_attribute_info();
  $hashref = $sth->private_attribute_info();

Returns a hash of all private attributes used by DBD::Oracle, for either
a database or a statement handle. Currently, all the hash values are undef.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO ALL HANDLES

=head2 B<InactiveDestroy> (boolean)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<RaiseError> (boolean, inherited)

Forces errors to always raise an exception. Although it defaults to off, it is recommended that this
be turned on, as the alternative is to check the return value of every method (prepare, execute, fetch, etc.)
manually, which is easy to forget to do.

=head2 B<PrintError> (boolean, inherited)

Forces database errors to also generate warnings, which can then be filtered with methods such as
locally redefining I<$SIG{__WARN__}> or using modules such as C<CGI::Carp>. This attribute is on
by default.

=head2 B<ShowErrorStatement> (boolean, inherited)

Appends information about the current statement to error messages. If placeholder information
is available, adds that as well. Defaults to true.

=head2 B<Warn> (boolean, inherited)

Enables warnings. This is on by default, and should only be turned off in a local block
for a short a time only when absolutely needed.

=head2 B<Executed> (boolean, read-only)

Indicates if a handle has been executed. For database handles, this value is true after the L</do> method has been called, or
when one of the child statement handles has issued an L</execute>. Issuing a L</commit> or L</rollback> always resets the
attribute to false for database handles. For statement handles, any call to L</execute> or its variants will flip the value to
true for the lifetime of the statement handle.

=head2 B<TraceLevel> (integer, inherited)

Sets the trace level, similar to the L</trace> method. See the sections on
L</trace> and L</parse_trace_flag> for more details.

=head2 B<Active> (boolean, read-only)

Indicates if a handle is active or not. For database handles, this indicates if the database has
been disconnected or not. For statement handles, it indicates if all the data has been fetched yet
or not. Use of this attribute is not encouraged.

=head2 B<Kids> (integer, read-only)

Returns the number of child processes created for each handle type. For a driver handle, indicates the number
of database handles created. For a database handle, indicates the number of statement handles created. For
statement handles, it always returns zero, because statement handles do not create kids.

=head2 B<ActiveKids> (integer, read-only)

Same as C<Kids>, but only returns those that are active.

=head2 B<CachedKids> (hash ref)

Returns a hashref of handles. If called on a database handle, returns all statement handles created by use of the
C<prepare_cached> method. If called on a driver handle, returns all database handles created by the L</connect_cached>
method.

=head2 B<ChildHandles> (array ref)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<PrintWarn> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<HandleError> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<HandleSetErr> (code ref, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<ErrCount> (unsigned integer)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<FetchHashKeyName> (string, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<ChopBlanks> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<Taint> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<TaintIn> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<TaintOut> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<Profile> (inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<Type> (scalar)

Returns C<dr> for a driver handle, C<db> for a database handle, and C<st> for a statement handle.
Should be rarely needed.

=head2 B<LongReadLen>

The maximum size of long or longraw columns to retrieve. If one of
these columns is longer than LongReadLen then either a data truncation
error will be raised (LongTrunkOk is false) or the column will be
silently truncated (LongTruncOk is true).

DBI currently defaults this to 80.

=head2 B<LongTruncOk>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<CompatMode>

Type: boolean, inherited

The CompatMode attribute is used by emulation layers (such as Oraperl) to enable compatible behaviour in the underlying driver (e.g., DBD::Oracle) for this handle. Not normally set by application code.

It also has the effect of disabling the 'quick FETCH' of attribute values from the handles attribute cache. So all attribute values are handled by the drivers own FETCH method. This makes them slightly slower but is useful for special-purpose drivers like DBD::Multiplex.

=head1 ORACLE-SPECIFIC DATABASE HANDLE METHODS

=head2 B<ora_can_unicode ( [ $refresh ] )>

Returns a number indicating whether either of the database character sets
is a Unicode encoding. Calls ora_nls_parameters() and passes the optional
$refresh parameter to it.

0 = Neither character set is a Unicode encoding.

1 = National character set is a Unicode encoding.

2 = Database character set is a Unicode encoding.

3 = Both character sets are Unicode encodings.

=head2 B<ora_can_taf>

Returns true if the current connection supports TAF events. False if otherwise.

=head2 B<ora_nls_parameters ( [ $refresh ] )>

Returns a hash reference containing the current NLS parameters, as given
by the v$nls_parameters view. The values fetched are cached between calls.
To cause the latest values to be fetched, pass a true value to the function.

=head1 ORACLE-SPECIFIC DATABASE FUNCTIONS

=head2 B<ora_server_version>

  $versions = $dbh->func('ora_server_version');

Returns an array reference of server version strings e.g.,

  [11,2,0,2,0]

=head1 DATABASE HANDLE METHODS

=head2 B<selectall_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql, \%attr);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Returns a reference to an array containing the rows returned by preparing and executing the SQL string.
See the DBI documentation for full details.

=head2 B<selectall_hashref>

  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectall_hashref($sql, $key_field);

Returns a reference to a hash containing the rows returned by preparing and executing the SQL string.
See the DBI documentation for full details.

=head2 B<selectcol_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Returns a reference to an array containing the first column
from each rows returned by preparing and executing the SQL string. It is possible to specify exactly
which columns to return. See the DBI documentation for full details.

=head2 B<prepare>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, \%attr);

Prepares a statement for later execution by the database engine and returns a reference to a statement handle object.

=head3 B<Prepare Attributes>

These attributes may be used in the C<\%attr> parameter of the
L<DBI/prepare> database handle method.

=over 4

=item ora_placeholders

Set to false to disable processing of placeholders. Used mainly for loading a
PL/SQL package that has been I<wrapped> with Oracle's C<wrap> utility.

=item ora_auto_lob

If true (the default), fetching retrieves the contents of the CLOB or
BLOB column in most circumstances.  If false, fetching retrieves the
Oracle "LOB Locator" of the CLOB or BLOB value.

See L</LOBS AND LONGS> for more details.

See also the LOB tests in 05dbi.t of Oracle::OCI for examples
of how to use LOB Locators.

=item ora_pers_lob

If true the L</Simple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs> method for the L</Data Interface for Persistent LOBs> will be
used for LOBs rather than the default method L</Data Interface for LOB Locators>.

=item ora_clbk_lob

If true the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback> method for the L</Data
Interface for Persistent LOBs> will be used for LOBs.

=item ora_piece_lob

If true the L</Piecewise Fetch with Polling> method for the L</Data
Interface for Persistent LOBs> will be used for LOBs.

=item ora_piece_size

This is the max piece size for the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback>
and L</Piecewise Fetch with Polling> methods, in chars for CLOBS, and
bytes for BLOBS.

=item ora_check_sql

If 1 (default), force SELECT statements to be described in prepare().
If 0, allow SELECT statements to defer describe until execute().

See L</Prepare Postponed Till Execute> for more information.

=item ora_exe_mode

This will set the execute mode of the current statement. Presently
only one mode is supported;

  OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY - make result set scrollable

See L</SCROLLABLE CURSORS> for more details.

=item ora_prefetch_rows

Sets the number of rows to be prefetched. If it is not set, then the
default value is 1.  See L</Row Prefetching> for more details.

=item ora_prefetch_memory

Sets the memory level for rows to be prefetched. The application then
fetches as many rows as will fit into that much memory.  See L</Row
Prefetching> for more details.

=item ora_row_cache_off

By default DBD::Oracle will use a row cache when fetching to cut down
the number of round trips to the server. If you do not want to use an
array fetch set this value to any value other than 0;

See L</Row Prefetching> for more details.

=head3 B<Placeholders>

There are three types of placeholders that can be used in
DBD::Oracle.

The first is the "question mark" type, in which each placeholder is
represented by a single question mark character. This is the method
