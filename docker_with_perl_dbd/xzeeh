=head4 ora_client_identifier

Allows you to specify the user identifier in the session handle.

Most useful for web applications as it can pass in the session user
name which might be different to the connection user name. Can be up
to 64 bytes long but do not to include the password for security
reasons and the first character of the identifier should not be
':'. This value can be retrieved on the server side using C<V$SESSION>
view.

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_client_identifier => $some_web_user });

  $dbh->{ora_client_identifier} = $local_user;

=head4 ora_action

Allows you to specify any string up to 32 bytes which may be retrieved
on the server side using C<V$SESSION> view.

   my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd, { ora_action => "Login"});

   $dbh->{ora_action} = "New Long Query 22";

NOTE: You will need an Oracle client 10.1 or later to use this.

=head4 ora_dbh_share

Requires at least Perl 5.8.0 compiled with ithreads (interpreter-based
threads).

Allows you to share database connections between threads. The first
connect will make the connection, all following calls to connect with
the same ora_dbh_share attribute will use the same database connection.
The value must be a reference to a already shared scalar which is
initialized to an empty string.

  our $orashr : shared = '' ;

  $dbh = DBI->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd, {ora_dbh_share => \$orashr}) ;

After shared connection is not needed any more, one should call

  DBD::Oracle::ora_shared_release($orashr);

This shall close shared connection. The function can be imported into
current namespace (use DBD::Oracle qw/ora_shared_release/)

Please keep in mind, this functionality is rather dangerous. One should not
use single connection in multiple threads at the same time, since access to server
is not atomic. There can be problems with transactions or fetching of rows.
It is much better to use sessions-pooling activated with B<ora_drcp>.

=head4 ora_events

Set this attribute to C<1> to enable Oracle Fast Application Notification
(FAN) in a new OCI environment. Can also be set via the C<ORA_EVENTS>
environment variable.

=head4 ora_charset, ora_ncharset

For oracle versions >= 9.2 you can specify the client charset and
ncharset with the ora_charset and ora_ncharset attributes.

These attributes override the settings from environment variables.

  $dbh = DBI->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd,
                       {ora_charset => 'AL32UTF8'});

=head4 ora_verbose

Use this value to enable DBD::Oracle only tracing.  Simply either set
the ora_verbose attribute on the connect() method to the trace level
you desire like this

  my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, "", "", {ora_verbose=>6});

or set it directly on the DB handle like this;

  $dbh->{ora_verbose} =6;

In both cases the DBD::Oracle trace level is set to 6, which is the highest
level tracing most of the calls to OCI.

NOTE: In future versions of DBD::Oracle ora_verbose will be changed so
that it is simply a switch to turn DBI's DBD tracing on or off.  A
true value will turn it on and a false value will turn it off.  DBI's
"DBD" tracing was not available when ora_verbose was created and
ora_verbose adds an additional test to every trace test.

=head4 ora_oci_success_warn

Use this value to print otherwise silent OCI warnings that may happen
when an execute or fetch returns "Success With Info" or when you want
to tune RowCaching and LOB Reads

  $dbh->{ora_oci_success_warn} = 1;

=head4 ora_objects

Use this value to enable extended embedded oracle objects mode. In extended:

=over 4

=item 1

Embedded objects are returned as <DBD::Oracle::Object> instance (including type-name etc.) instead of simple ARRAY.

=item 2

Determine object type for each instance. All object attributes are returned (not only super-type's attributes).

=back

  $dbh->{ora_objects} = 1;

=head4 ora_ph_type

The default placeholder datatype for the database session.
The C<TYPE> or L</ora_type> attributes to L<DBI/bind_param> and
L<DBI/bind_param_inout> override the datatype for individual placeholders.
The most frequent reason for using this attribute is to permit trailing spaces
in values passed by placeholders.

Constants for the values allowed for this attribute can be imported using

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

Only the following values are permitted for this attribute.

=over 4

=item ORA_VARCHAR2

Oracle clients using OCI 8 will strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \0 bytes.
Oracle clients using OCI 9.2 do not strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \0 bytes.
This is the normal default placeholder type.

=item ORA_STRING

Do not strip trailing spaces and end the string at the first \0.

=item ORA_CHAR

Do not strip trailing spaces and allow embedded \0.
Force 'blank-padded comparison semantics'.

For example:

  use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);

  $SQL="select username from all_users where username = ?";
  #username is a char(8)
  $sth=$dbh->prepare($SQL)";
  $sth->bind_param(1,'bloggs',{ ora_type => ORA_CHAR});

Will pad bloggs out to 8 characters and return the username.

=back

=head4 ora_parse_error_offset

If the previous error was from a failed C<prepare> due to a syntax error,
this attribute gives the offset into the C<Statement> attribute where the
error was found.

=head4 ora_array_chunk_size

Due to OCI limitations, DBD::Oracle needs to buffer up rows of
bind values in its C<execute_for_fetch> implementation. This attribute
sets the number of rows to buffer at a time (default value is 1000).

The C<execute_for_fetch> function will collect (at most) this many
rows in an array, send them off to the DB for execution, then go back
to collect the next chunk of rows and so on. This attribute can be
used to limit or extend the number of rows processed at a time.

Note that this attribute also applies to C<execute_array>, since that
method is implemented using C<execute_for_fetch>.

=head4 ora_connect_with_default_signals

Sometimes the Oracle client seems to change some of the signal
handlers of the process during the connect phase.  For instance, some
users have observed Perl's default C<$SIG{INT}> handler being ignored
after connecting to an Oracle database.  If this causes problems in
your application, set this attribute to an array reference of signals
you would like to be localized during the connect process.  Once the
connect is complete, the signal handlers should be returned to their
previous state.

For example:

  $dbh = DBI->connect ($dsn, $user, $passwd,
                       {ora_connect_with_default_signals => [ 'INT' ] });

NOTE disabling the signal handlers the OCI library sets up may affect
functionality in the OCI library.

NOTE If you are using connect_cached then the above example will lead
to DBI thinking each connection is different as an anonymous array reference
is being used. To avoid this when using connect_cached you are advised
to use:

  my @ora_default_signals = (...);
  $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $passwd,
      {ora_connect_with_default_signals => \@ora_default_signals});

In more recent Perl versions you could possibly make use of new state
variables.

=head2 B<connect_cached>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.
Please note that connect_cached has not been tested with DRCP.

=head2 B<data_sources>

  @data_sources = DBI->data_sources('Oracle');
  @data_sources = $dbh->data_sources();

Returns a list of available databases. You will have to set either the 'ORACLE_HOME' or
'TNS_ADMIN' environment value to retrieve this list.  It will read these values from
TNSNAMES.ORA file entries.

=head1 METHODS COMMON TO ALL HANDLES

For all of the methods below, B<$h> can be either a database handle (B<$dbh>)
or a statement handle (B<$sth>). Note that I<$dbh> and I<$sth> can be replaced with
any variable name you choose: these are just the names most often used. Another
common variable used in this documentation is $I<rv>, which stands for "return value".

=head2 B<err>

  $rv = $h->err;

Returns the error code from the last method called.

=head2 B<errstr>

  $str = $h->errstr;

Returns the last error that was reported by Oracle. Starting with "ORA-00000" code followed by the error message.

=head2 B<state>

  $str = $h->state;

Oracle hasn't supported SQLSTATE since the early versions OCI. It will return empty when the command succeeds and
'S1000' (General Error) for all other errors.

While this method can be called as either C<< $sth->state >> or C<< $dbh->state >>, it
is usually clearer to always use C<< $dbh->state >>.

=head2 B<trace>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<trace_msg>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<parse_trace_flag> and B<parse_trace_flags>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<func>

DBD::Oracle uses the C<func> method to support a variety of functions.

=head2 B<Private database handle functions>

Some of these functions are called through the method func()
which is described in the DBI documentation. Any function that begins with ora_
can be called directly.

=head2 B<plsql_errstr>

This function returns a string which describes the errors
from the most recent PL/SQL function, procedure, package,
or package body compile in a format similar to the output
of the SQL*Plus command 'show errors'.

The function returns undef if the error string could not
be retrieved due to a database error.
Look in $dbh->errstr for the cause of the failure.

If there are no compile errors, an empty string is returned.

Example:

    # Show the errors if CREATE PROCEDURE fails
    $dbh->{RaiseError} = 0;
    if ( $dbh->do( q{
        CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE perl_dbd_oracle_test as
        BEGIN
            PROCEDURE filltab( stuff OUT TAB ); asdf
        END; } ) ) {} # Statement succeeded
    }
    elsif ( 6550 != $dbh->err ) { die $dbh->errstr; } # Utter failure
    else {
        my $msg = $dbh->func( 'plsql_errstr' );
        die $dbh->errstr if ! defined $msg;
        die $msg if $msg;
    }

=head2 B<dbms_output_enable / dbms_output_put / dbms_output_get>

These functions use the PL/SQL DBMS_OUTPUT package to store and
retrieve text using the DBMS_OUTPUT buffer.  Text stored in this buffer
by dbms_output_put or any PL/SQL block can be retrieved by
dbms_output_get or any PL/SQL block connected to the same database
session.

Stored text is not available until after dbms_output_put or the PL/SQL
block that saved it completes its execution.  This means you B<CAN NOT>
use these functions to monitor long running PL/SQL procedures.

Example 1:

  # Enable DBMS_OUTPUT and set the buffer size
  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
  $dbh->func( 1000000, 'dbms_output_enable' );

  # Put text in the buffer . . .
  $dbh->func( @text, 'dbms_output_put' );

  # . . . and retrieve it later
  @text = $dbh->func( 'dbms_output_get' );

Example 2:

  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
  $sth = $dbh->prepare(q{
    DECLARE tmp VARCHAR2(50);
    BEGIN
      SELECT SYSDATE INTO tmp FROM DUAL;
      dbms_output.put_line('The date is '||tmp);
    END;
  });
  $sth->execute;

  # retrieve the string
  $date_string = $dbh->func( 'dbms_output_get' );

=head2 B<dbms_output_enable ( [ buffer_size ] )>

This function calls DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE to enable calls to package
DBMS_OUTPUT procedures GET, GET_LINE, PUT, and PUT_LINE.  Calls to
these procedures are ignored unless DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE is called
first.

The buffer_size is the maximum amount of text that can be saved in the
buffer and must be between 2000 and 1,000,000.  If buffer_size is not
given, the default is 20,000 bytes.

=head2 B<dbms_output_put ( [ @lines ] )>

This function calls DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE to add lines to the buffer.

If all lines were saved successfully the function returns 1.  Depending
on the context, an empty list or undef is returned for failure.

If any line causes buffer_size to be exceeded, a buffer overflow error
is raised and the function call fails.  Some of the text might be in
the buffer.

=head2 B<dbms_output_get>

This function calls DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE to retrieve lines of text from
the buffer.

In an array context, all complete lines are removed from the buffer and
returned as a list.  If there are no complete lines, an empty list is
returned.

In a scalar context, the first complete line is removed from the buffer
and returned.  If there are no complete lines, undef is returned.

Any text in the buffer after a call to DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE or
DBMS_OUTPUT.GET is discarded by the next call to DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE,
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT, or DBMS_OUTPUT.NEW_LINE.

=head2 B<reauthenticate ( $username, $password )>

Starts a new session against the current database using the credentials
supplied. Note that this does not work with DRCP.

=head2 B<private_attribute_info>

  $hashref = $dbh->private_attribute_info();
  $hashref = $sth->private_attribute_info();

Returns a hash of all private attributes used by DBD::Oracle, for either
a database or a statement handle. Currently, all the hash values are undef.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO ALL HANDLES

=head2 B<InactiveDestroy> (boolean)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<RaiseError> (boolean, inherited)

Forces errors to always raise an exception. Although it defaults to off, it is recommended that this
be turned on, as the alternative is to check the return value of every method (prepare, execute, fetch, etc.)
manually, which is easy to forget to do.

=head2 B<PrintError> (boolean, inherited)

Forces database errors to also generate warnings, which can then be filtered with methods such as
locally redefining I<$SIG{__WARN__}> or using modules such as C<CGI::Carp>. This attribute is on
by default.

=head2 B<ShowErrorStatement> (boolean, inherited)

Appends information about the current statement to error messages. If placeholder information
is available, adds that as well. Defaults to true.

=head2 B<Warn> (boolean, inherited)

Enables warnings. This is on by default, and should only be turned off in a local block
for a short a time only when absolutely needed.

=head2 B<Executed> (boolean, read-only)

Indicates if a handle has been executed. For database handles, this value is true after the L</do> method has been called, or
when one of the child statement handles has issued an L</execute>. Issuing a L</commit> or L</rollback> always resets the
attribute to false for database handles. For statement handles, any call to L</execute> or its variants will flip the value to
true for the lifetime of the statement handle.

=head2 B<TraceLevel> (integer, inherited)

Sets the trace level, similar to the L</trace> method. See the sections on
L</trace> and L</parse_trace_flag> for more details.

=head2 B<Active> (boolean, read-only)

Indicates if a handle is active or not. For database handles, this indicates if the database has
been disconnected or not. For statement handles, it indicates if all the data has been fetched yet
or not. Use of this attribute is not encouraged.

=head2 B<Kids> (integer, read-only)

Returns the number of child processes created for each handle type. For a driver handle, indicates the number
of database handles created. For a database handle, indicates the number of statement handles created. For
statement handles, it always returns zero, because statement handles do not create kids.

=head2 B<ActiveKids> (integer, read-only)

Same as C<Kids>, but only returns those that are active.

=head2 B<CachedKids> (hash ref)

Returns a hashref of handles. If called on a database handle, returns all statement handles created by use of the
C<prepare_cached> method. If called on a driver handle, returns all database handles created by the L</connect_cached>
method.

=head2 B<ChildHandles> (array ref)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<PrintWarn> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<HandleError> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<HandleSetErr> (code ref, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<ErrCount> (unsigned integer)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<FetchHashKeyName> (string, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<ChopBlanks> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<Taint> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<TaintIn> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<TaintOut> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<Profile> (inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<Type> (scalar)

Returns C<dr> for a driver handle, C<db> for a database handle, and C<st> for a statement handle.
Should be rarely needed.

=head2 B<LongReadLen>

The maximum size of long or longraw columns to retrieve. If one of
these columns is longer than LongReadLen then either a data truncation
error will be raised (LongTrunkOk is false) or the column will be
silently truncated (LongTruncOk is true).

DBI currently defaults this to 80.

=head2 B<LongTruncOk>

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=head2 B<CompatMode>

Type: boolean, inherited

The CompatMode attribute is used by emulation layers (such as Oraperl) to enable compatible behaviour in the underlying driver (e.g., DBD::Oracle) for this handle. Not normally set by application code.

It also has the effect of disabling the 'quick FETCH' of attribute values from the handles attribute cache. So all attribute values are handled by the drivers own FETCH method. This makes them slightly slower but is useful for special-purpose drivers like DBD::Multiplex.

=head1 ORACLE-SPECIFIC DATABASE HANDLE METHODS

=head2 B<ora_can_unicode ( [ $refresh ] )>

Returns a number indicating whether either of the database character sets
is a Unicode encoding. Calls ora_nls_parameters() and passes the optional
$refresh parameter to it.

0 = Neither character set is a Unicode encoding.

1 = National character set is a Unicode encoding.

2 = Database character set is a Unicode encoding.

3 = Both character sets are Unicode encodings.

=head2 B<ora_can_taf>

Returns true if the current connection supports TAF events. False if otherwise.

=head2 B<ora_nls_parameters ( [ $refresh ] )>

Returns a hash reference containing the current NLS parameters, as given
by the v$nls_parameters view. The values fetched are cached between calls.
To cause the latest values to be fetched, pass a true value to the function.

=head1 ORACLE-SPECIFIC DATABASE FUNCTIONS

=head2 B<ora_server_version>

  $versions = $dbh->func('ora_server_version');

Returns an array reference of server version strings e.g.,

  [11,2,0,2,0]

=head1 DATABASE HANDLE METHODS

=head2 B<selectall_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql, \%attr);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Returns a reference to an array containing the rows returned by preparing and executing the SQL string.
See the DBI documentation for full details.

=head2 B<selectall_hashref>

  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectall_hashref($sql, $key_field);

Returns a reference to a hash containing the rows returned by preparing and executing the SQL string.
See the DBI documentation for full details.

=head2 B<selectcol_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Returns a reference to an array containing the first column
from each rows returned by preparing and executing the SQL string. It is possible to specify exactly
which columns to return. See the DBI documentation for full details.

=head2 B<prepare>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, \%attr);

Prepares a statement for later execution by the database engine and returns a reference to a statement handle object.

=head3 B<Prepare Attributes>

These attributes may be used in the C<\%attr> parameter of the
L<DBI/prepare> database handle method.

=over 4

=item ora_placeholders

Set to false to disable processing of placeholders. Used mainly for loading a
PL/SQL package that has been I<wrapped> with Oracle's C<wrap> utility.

=item ora_auto_lob

If true (the default), fetching retrieves the contents of the CLOB or
BLOB column in most circumstances.  If false, fetching retrieves the
Oracle "LOB Locator" of the CLOB or BLOB value.

See L</LOBS AND LONGS> for more details.

See also the LOB tests in 05dbi.t of Oracle::OCI for examples
of how to use LOB Locators.

=item ora_pers_lob

If true the L</Simple Fetch for CLOBs and BLOBs> method for the L</Data Interface for Persistent LOBs> will be
used for LOBs rather than the default method L</Data Interface for LOB Locators>.

=item ora_clbk_lob

If true the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback> method for the L</Data
Interface for Persistent LOBs> will be used for LOBs.

=item ora_piece_lob

If true the L</Piecewise Fetch with Polling> method for the L</Data
Interface for Persistent LOBs> will be used for LOBs.

=item ora_piece_size

This is the max piece size for the L</Piecewise Fetch with Callback>
and L</Piecewise Fetch with Polling> methods, in chars for CLOBS, and
bytes for BLOBS.

=item ora_check_sql

If 1 (default), force SELECT statements to be described in prepare().
If 0, allow SELECT statements to defer describe until execute().

See L</Prepare Postponed Till Execute> for more information.

=item ora_exe_mode

This will set the execute mode of the current statement. Presently
only one mode is supported;

  OCI_STMT_SCROLLABLE_READONLY - make result set scrollable

See L</SCROLLABLE CURSORS> for more details.

=item ora_prefetch_rows

Sets the number of rows to be prefetched. If it is not set, then the
default value is 1.  See L</Row Prefetching> for more details.

=item ora_prefetch_memory

Sets the memory level for rows to be prefetched. The application then
fetches as many rows as will fit into that much memory.  See L</Row
Prefetching> for more details.

=item ora_row_cache_off

By default DBD::Oracle will use a row cache when fetching to cut down
the number of round trips to the server. If you do not want to use an
array fetch set this value to any value other than 0;

See L</Row Prefetching> for more details.

=back

=head3 B<Placeholders>

There are three types of placeholders that can be used in
DBD::Oracle.

The first is the "question mark" type, in which each placeholder is
represented by a single question mark character. This is the method
recommended by the DBI and is the most portable. Each question
mark is internally replaced by a "dollar sign number" in the order in
which they appear in the query (important when using L</bind_param>).

The second type of placeholder is "named parameters" in the format
":foo" which is the one Oracle prefers.

   $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
   $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name LIKE :name");
   $sth->bind_param(':name', "John%");
   $sth->execute;
   DBI::dump_results($sth);

Note when calling bind_param with named parameters you must include
the leading colon. The advantage of this placeholder type is that you
can use the same placeholder more than once in the same SQL statement
but you only need to bind it once.

The last placeholder type is a variation of the two above where you
name each placeholder :N (where N is a number). Like the named
placeholders above you can use the same placeholder multiple times in
the SQL but when you call bind_param you only need to pass the N
(e.g., for :1 you use bind_param(1,...) and not bind_param(':1',...).

The different types of placeholders cannot be mixed within a statement, but you may
use different ones for each statement handle you have. This is confusing at best, so
stick to one style within your program.

=head2 B<prepare_cached>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare_cached($statement, \%attr);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact. This method is most useful
if the same query is used over and over as it will cut down round trips to the server.

=head2 B<do>

  $rv = $dbh->do($statement);
  $rv = $dbh->do($statement, \%attr);
  $rv = $dbh->do($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows affected if the
query was successful, returns undef if an error occurred, and returns -1 if the
number of rows is unknown or not available. Note that this method will return B<0E0> instead
of 0 for 'no rows were affected', in order to always return a true value if no error occurred.

=head2 B<last_insert_id>

Oracle does not implement auto_increment of serial type columns it uses predefined
sequences where the id numbers are either selected before insert, at insert time with a trigger,
 or as part of the query.

Below is an example of you to use the latter with the SQL returning clause to get the ID number back
on insert with the bind_param_inout method.
.

  $dbh->do('CREATE SEQUENCE lii_seq START 1');
  $dbh->do(q{CREATE TABLE lii (
    foobar INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    baz VARCHAR)});
  $SQL = "INSERT INTO lii (foobar,baz) VALUES (lii_seq.nextval,'XX') returning foobar into :p_new_id";";
  $sth = $dbh->prepare($SQL);
  my $p_new_id='-1';
  $sth->bind_param_inout(":p_new_id",\$p_new_id,38);
  $sth->execute();
  $db->commit();

=head2 B<commit>

  $rv = $dbh->commit;

Issues a COMMIT to the server, indicating that the current transaction is finished and that
all changes made will be visible to other processes. If AutoCommit is enabled, then
a warning is given and no COMMIT is issued. Returns true on success, false on error.

=head2 B<rollback>

  $rv = $dbh->rollback;

Issues a ROLLBACK to the server, which discards any changes made in the current transaction. If AutoCommit
is enabled, then a warning is given and no ROLLBACK is issued. Returns true on success, and
false on error.

=head2 B<begin_work>

This method turns on transactions until the next call to L</commit> or L</rollback>, if L</AutoCommit> is
currently enabled. If it is not enabled, calling begin_work will issue an error. Note that the
transaction will not actually begin until the first statement after begin_work is called.

=head2 B<disconnect>

  $rv = $dbh->disconnect;

Disconnects from the Oracle database. Any uncommitted changes will be rolled back upon disconnection. It's
good policy to always explicitly call commit or rollback at some point before disconnecting, rather than
relying on the default rollback behavior.

If the script exits before disconnect is called (or, more precisely, if the database handle is no longer
referenced by anything), then the database handle's DESTROY method will call the rollback() and disconnect()
methods automatically. It is best to explicitly disconnect rather than rely on this behavior.

=head2 B<ping>

  $rv = $dbh->ping;

This C<ping> method is used to check the validity of a database handle. The value returned is
either 0, indicating that the connection is no longer valid, or 1, indicating the connection is valid.
This function does 1 round trip to the Oracle Server.

=head2 B<get_info()>

 $value = $dbh->get_info($info_type);

DBD::Oracle supports C<get_info()>, but (currently) only a few info types.

=head2 B<table_info()>

DBD::Oracle supports attributes for C<table_info()>.

In Oracle, the concept of I<user> and I<schema> is (currently) the
same. Because database objects are owned by an user, the owner names
in the data dictionary views correspond to schema names.
Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.

Search patterns are supported for TABLE_SCHEM and TABLE_NAME.

TABLE_TYPE may contain a comma-separated list of table types.
The following table types are supported:

  TABLE
  VIEW
  SYNONYM
  SEQUENCE

The result set is ordered by TABLE_TYPE, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME.

The special enumerations of catalogues, schemas and table types are
supported. However, TABLE_CAT is always NULL.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
C<table_info()> performs a case-sensitive search. So, a selection
criterion should respect upper and lower case.
Normally, an identifier is case-insensitive. Oracle stores and
returns it in upper case. Sometimes, database objects are created
with quoted identifiers (for reserved words, mixed case, special
characters, ...). Such an identifier is case-sensitive (if not all
upper case). Oracle stores and returns it as given.
C<table_info()> has no special quote handling, neither adds nor
removes quotes.

=head2 B<primary_key_info()>

Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.
The TABLE_CAT field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

If the primary key constraint was created without an identifier,
PK_NAME contains a system generated name with the form SYS_Cn.

The result set is ordered by TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, KEY_SEQ.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

=head2 B<foreign_key_info()>

This method (currently) supports the extended behaviour of SQL/CLI, i.e. the
result set contains foreign keys that refer to primary B<and> alternate keys.
The field UNIQUE_OR_PRIMARY distinguishes these keys.

Oracle does not support catalogues, so C<$pk_catalog> and C<$fk_catalog> are
ignored as selection criteria (in the new style interface).
The UK_TABLE_CAT and FK_TABLE_CAT fields of a fetched row are always
NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

If the primary or foreign key constraints were created without an identifier,
UK_NAME or FK_NAME contains a system generated name with the form SYS_Cn.

The UPDATE_RULE field is always 3 ('NO ACTION'), because Oracle (currently)
does not support other actions.

The DELETE_RULE field may contain wrong values. This is a known Bug (#1271663)
in Oracle's data dictionary views. Currently (as of 8.1.7), 'RESTRICT' and
'SET DEFAULT' are not supported, 'CASCADE' is mapped correctly and all other
actions (incl. 'SET NULL') appear as 'NO ACTION'.

The DEFERABILITY field is always NULL, because this columns is
not present in the ALL_CONSTRAINTS view of older Oracle releases.

The result set is ordered by UK_TABLE_SCHEM, UK_TABLE_NAME, FK_TABLE_SCHEM,
FK_TABLE_NAME, ORDINAL_POSITION.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

=head2 B<column_info()>

Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.
The TABLE_CAT field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

The CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH field is (currently) always NULL (undef).

Don't rely on the values of the BUFFER_LENGTH field!
Especially the length of FLOATs may be wrong.

Datatype codes for non-standard types are subject to change.

Attention! The DATA_DEFAULT (COLUMN_DEF) column is of type LONG so you
may have to set LongReadLen on the connection handle before calling
column_info if you have a large default column. After DBD::Oracle 1.40
LongReadLen is set automatically to 1Mb when calling column_info and
reset aftwerwards.

The result set is ordered by TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, ORDINAL_POSITION.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

It is possible with Oracle to make the names of the various DB objects (table,column,index etc)
case sensitive.

  alter table bloggind add ("Bla_BLA" NUMBER)

So in the example the exact case "Bla_BLA" must be used to get it info on the column. While this

 alter table bloggind add (Bla_BLA NUMBER)

any case can be used to get info on the column.

=head2 B<statistics_info()>

Oracle does not support catalogues so TABLE_CAT is ignored as
selection criterion.
The TABLE_CAT field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef).
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

The INDEX_QUALIFIER field of a fetched row is always NULL (undef),
for the same reason as for TABLE_CAT.

If an index was created without an identifier
(e.g. in the course of a PK creation),
INDEX_NAME contains a system generated name with the form SYS_.

COLUMN_NAME may contain a system generated name
(e.g. for function-based indexes).

For the TYPE column, a simple mapping is used:

  NORMAL   btree
  CLUSTER  clustered
  ...      other

The C<$quick> parameter is currently ignored.
The method uses the dictionary with the gathered statistics,
thus cannot ensure that the values for CARDINALITY and PAGES are current.

The result set is ordered by
NON_UNIQUE, TYPE, INDEX_QUALIFIER, INDEX_NAME, ORDINAL_POSITION.

An identifier is passed I<as is>, i.e. as the user provides or
Oracle returns it.
See L</table_info()> for more detailed information.

=head2 B<selectrow_array>

  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($sql);
  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($sql, \%attr);
  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Returns an array of row information after preparing and executing the provided SQL string. The rows are returned
by calling L</fetchrow_array>. The string can also be a statement handle generated by a previous prepare. Note that
only the first row of data is returned. If called in a scalar context, only the first column of the first row is
returned. Because this is not portable, it is not recommended that you use this method in that way.

=head2 B<selectrow_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectrow_arrayref($statement);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectrow_arrayref($statement, \%attr);
  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectrow_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Exactly the same as L</selectrow_array>, except that it returns a reference to an array, by internal use of
the L</fetchrow_arrayref> method.

=head2 B<selectrow_hashref>

  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectrow_hashref($sql);
  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectrow_hashref($sql, \%attr);
  $hash_ref = $dbh->selectrow_hashref($sql, \%attr, @bind_values);

Exactly the same as L</selectrow_array>, except that it returns a reference to an hash, by internal use of
the L</fetchrow_hashref> method.

=head2 B<clone>

  $other_dbh = $dbh->clone();

Creates a copy of the database handle by connecting with the same parameters as the original
handle, then trying to merge the attributes. See the DBI documentation for complete usage.

=head1 DATABASE HANDLE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<AutoCommit> (boolean)

Supported by DBD::Oracle as proposed by DBI.The default of AutoCommit is on, but this may change
in the future, so it is highly recommended that you explicitly set it when
calling L</connect>.
