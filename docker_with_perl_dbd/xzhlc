When changing the crypt key the buffer should be considered modified.
Like when changing 'fileformat'.  Save the old key in save_file_ff().

Strange sequence of BufWipeout and BufNew events while doing omni-complete.
(Paul Jolly, #5656)
Get BufDelete without preceding BufNew. (Paul Jolly, #5694)
    Later more requests for what to track.
    Should we add new events that don't allow any buffer manipulation?
    Really only for dealing with appearing and disappearing buffers, load and
    unload.

Patch to add an option to enable/disable VTP.  (Nobuhiro Takasaki, #5344)
Should have three values: empty, "off", "on".  Name it 'winterm'?

Patch to fix session file when using multiple tab pages. (Jason Franklin, 2019
May 20)
Also put :argadd commands at the start for all buffers, so that their order
remains equal?  Then %argdel to clean it up.  Do try this with 'hidden' set.
Also #5326: netrw buffers are not restored.

When 'backupdir' has a path ending in double slash (meaning: use full path of
the file) combined with 'patchmode' the file name is wrong. (#5791)

Completion mixes results from the current buffer with tags and other files.
Happens when typing CTRL-N while still searching for results.  E.g., type "b_"
in terminal.c and then CTRL-N twice.
Should do current file first and not split it up when more results are found.
(Also #1890)

Help for ":argadd fname" says that if "fname" is already in the argument list
that entry is used.  But instead it's always added. (#6210)
Add flag AL_FIND_ADD, if there is one argument find it in the list.

Statusline highlighting error, off by one. (#5599)

Patch to add new motion ]( and ]{.  (Yasuhiro Matsumoto, #5320)
Better: use the "z" prefix.  or ]t) and [t(.

Visual highlight not removed when 'display' is "lastline" and line doesn't
fit. (Kevin Lawler, #4457)

Current position in the changelist should be local to the buffer. (#2173)

Does not build with MinGW out of the box:
- _stat64 is not defined, need to use "struct stat" in vim.h
- WINVER conflict, should use 0x0600 by default?
- INT_MAX not defined: need to include <limits.h> in vim.h

Display messed up with matchparen, wrapping and scrolling. (#5638)
Screen update bug related to matchparen.  (Chris Heath, 2017 Mar 4, #1532)

When getting a focus event halfway a mapping this aborts the mapping.  E.g.
when "qq" is mapped and after the first "q" the mouse is moved outside of the
gvim window (with focus follows mouse), then the K_FOCUSLOST key is put in the
input buffer. (#5302)

Check_external_diff() is used too often. (Daniel Hahler, #4800)

Updated 2016 Jun 10, #858  Update 2017 Mar 28: use <buffer>.
Better use ":bufgrep" ?

Improve fallback for menu translations, to avoid having to create lots of
files that source the actual file.  E.g. menu_da_de -> menu_da
Include part of #3242?

Patch to have text objects defined by arbitrary single characters. (Daniel
Thau, 2013 Nov 20, 2014 Jan 29, 2014 Jan 31)
Added tests (James McCoy, 2016 Aug 3, #958).  Still needs more work.

Would be nice to set tab-local values for 'diffexpr' and 'diffopt'.  Use
t:diffexpr_option t:diffopt_option? (#4782)
Also make 'scrollopt' tab-local, remove "hor" only for the current tab page.

work, results in "E479: No match". (#4610)

7   Add an option to add one pixel column to the character width?  Lucida
    Console italic is wider than the normal font ("d" overlaps with next char).
    Opposite of 'linespace': 'columnspace'.
Patch for this (Tristan Konolige, #1011, only added the option, no implem.)

Bug: script written with "-W scriptout" contains Key codes, while the script
read with "-s scriptin" expects escape codes.  Probably "scriptout" needs to
be adjusted. (Daniel Steinberg, 2019 Feb 24, #4041)

Window size changes after closing a tab. (#4741)

Bug: "vipgw" does not put cursor back where it belongs. (Jason Franklin, 2019
Mar 5)

Some composing characters actually add a cell width to the character they are
on top off, making the whole thing two characters wide. (#4526)

Should we include some part of pull request #4505, not increment changedtick
in some cases?  E.g. for ":write" when the changed flag was already off, the
buffer didn't change at all.

When using a timer callback vgetc_busy is reset, allowing for using input().
But in a channel callback this does not happen.  We need to do something
similar to check_due_timer().  Also see #3809.

C syntax: {} inside () causes following {} to be highlighted as error.
(Michalis Giannakidis, 2006 Jun 1)

Check: __attribute__((format(printf, on semsg() and siemsg().  Where was this
added?

Add test for urxvt mouse codes.  Also test that mouse coordinates can be
negative. (see #4326)

'cmdheight' has a tab-local value, but it cannot be obtained with
`:echo gettabwinvar(2, 1, '&cmdheight')` returns the value for the _current_
tab page. (Ingo Karkat, #4324)
:call settabwinvar(1, 1, '&cmdheight', 2) also doesn't work well.

When opening a file, allow for specifying the initial column position:
    vim +12:5 file.txt   line 12 column 5
    :edit +12:5 file.txt
Should probably use the column as the character index.

This modeline throws unexpected errors: (#4165)
    vim: syn=nosyntax

Make balloon_show() work outside of 'balloonexpr'?  Users expect it to work:
#2948. (related to #1512?)
Also see #2352, want better control over balloon, perhaps set the position.
Should also be possible to add highlighting, like in the status line?
balloonexpr() on MS-Windows GUI doesn't handle accented chars? (nivaemail,
2018 Sep 14)

More warnings from static analysis:

Not existing directory in CDPATH leads to two shell calls. (#4525)

Use dict_iterate_start() / dict_iterate_next() instead of relying on the
internals of the dict structure.

nvo-mode mapping works on Windows, not on Linux. (#3678)

Redo only remembers the last change.  Could use "{count}g." to redo an older
change.  How does the user know which change?  At least have a way to list
them: ":repeats".  Add to history, like search history and command line history.

When 'confirm' is set a "silent q" doesn't show the prompt.  It should in this
case. (Nate Peterson, 2019 Jan 31, #3892)
For "silent! q" it should not prompt and just fail.

Add <aevent>, which expands to the currently triggered autocommand event name.
(Daniel Hahler, #4232)  Or add it to v:event (easier to use but slightly more
expensive).

Some xterm responses are not properly handled: (Markus Gömmel, 2019 Apr 1)
    DCS 0 $ r Pt ST    should be ignored.
    DCS 0 + r/Pt/  ST  already ignored?

Using CTRL-L to add a character to the search string that contains \v,
punctuation is repeated. (Smylers, 2018 Nov 17, #3621)

Using single wide base character with double wide composing character gives
drawing errors.  Fill up the base character?  (Dominique, #4328)

When 'sidescrolloff' is set, using "zl" to go to the end of the line, suddenly
scrolls back.  Should allow for this scrolling, like 'scrolloff' does when
using CTRL-E. (Yee Cheng Chin, #3721)

Add function to make use of internal diff, working on two lists and returning
unified diff (list of lines).

When splitting a window with few text lines, the relative cursor position is
kept, which means part of the text isn't displayed.  Better show all the text
when possible. (Dylan Lloyd, #3973)

Make ":interactive !cmd" stop termcap mode, also when used in an autocommand.
(#3692)

Add something like 'fillchars' local to window, but allow for specifying a
highlight name.  Esp. for the statusline.
And "extends" and "precedes" are also useful without 'list' set.  Also in
'fillchars' or another option?

Sourceforge Vim pages still have content, make them empty, keep redirect.
Check for PHP errors. (Wayne Davison, 2018 Oct 26)

Problem with Visual yank when 'linebreak' and 'showbreak' are set.
Patch with tests, but it's not clear how it is supposed to work. (tommm, 2018
Nov 17)  Asked about this, Dec 22. Christian will have a look.

Update for xim-input-style help (Tony Mechelynck, 2019 Jan 10).
Feedback from someone who uses this?

Only output t_Cs when t_Ce is also set.  do not use Cs and Ce termcap entries.  (Daniel Hahler, 2018 Sep 25)
Add t_cS and t_cR for cursor color select and reset.  Use Cs and Cr terminfo
values.

Further xdiff changes:
- More options, e.g. different kind of whitespace diff.
- when editing text, update the surrounding diff blocks.
- omit diff.exe from distribution
- Can we make this show differences within a line?
- add option to use external diff above a certain size.

Difference between two regexp engines: #3373

When the last line wraps, selecting with the mouse below that line only
includes the first screen line. (2018 Aug 23, #3368)

Refactored HTML indent file. (Michael Lee, #1821)
Asked to write a test.

Merge checking for 'cursorline' and 'concealcursor', see neovim #9492.

Add a windowID argument to placing a sign, so that it only shows up in one
window for the buffer.

Compiler warning (geeknik, 2017 Oct 26):

Patch to list user digraphs. (Christian Brabandt, 2012 Apr 14)

Setting 'columns' in a BufEnter autocommand causes a second tab width to
behave strangely, as if there is a gap and a vertical window separator.
(Michael Soyka, 2018 Sep 23, #3477)

Add an option similar to 'lazyredraw' to skip redrawing while executing a
script or function.

Using a menu item while the "more" prompt is displayed doesn't work well.
E.g. after using help->version.  Have a key that ends the "more" prompt and
does nothing otherwise?

MS-Windows: write may fail if another program is reading the file.
If 'readonly' is not set but the file appears to be readonly later, try again
(wait a little while).
CreateFile() returns ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION (Linwei, 2018 May 5)

Using --remote to open a file in which a # appears does not work on
MS-Windows.  Perhaps in \#  the \ is seen as a path separator. (Axel Bender,
2017 Feb 9)  Can we expand wildcards first and send the path literally to the
receiving Vim?  Or make an exception for #, it's not useful remotely.

Column number is wrong when using 'linebreak' and 'wrap'. (Keith Smiley, 2018
Jan 15, #2555)

Add Makefiles to the runtime/spell directory tree, since nobody uses Aap.
Will have to explain the manual steps (downloading the .aff and .dic files,
applying the diff, etc.

User dictionary ~/.vim/spell/lang.utf-8.add not used for spell checking until a
word is re-added to it. (Matej Cepl, 2018 Feb 6)

Fold at end of the buffer behaves inconsistently. (James McCoy, 2017 Oct 9)

Implement option_save() and option_restore():
option_restore({list})					*option_restore()*
		Restore options previously saved by option_save().
		When buffer-local options have been saved, this function must
		be called when the same buffer is the current buffer.
		When window-local options have been saved, this function must
		be called when the same window is the current window.
		When in the wrong buffer and/or window an error is given and
		the local options won't be restored.

option_save({list})					*option_save()*
		Saves the options named in {list}.  The returned value can be
		passed to option_restore().  Example: >
			let s:saved_options = option_save([
			    \ 'ignorecase',
			    \ 'iskeyword',
			    \ ])
			 au <buffer> BufLeave *
			    \ call option_restore(s:saved_options)
<		The advantage over using `:let` is that global and local
		values are handled and the script ID is restored, so that
		`:verbose set` will show where the option was originally set,
		not where it was restored.
  Alternatively: save and restore ALL options.  Implementation needs to use
	copy-on-write.  Return an ID from option_save(), when
	option_restore(ID) is called give an error if another option_save()
	was called in the meantime, they must be balanced.

"gvim --remote" from a directory with non-word characters changes the current

When 'virtualedit' is "all" and 'cursorcolumn' is set, the wrong column may be
highlighted. (van-de-bugger, 2018 Jan 23, #2576)

No profile information for function that executes ":quit". (Daniel Hahler,
2017 Dec 26, #2501)

A function on a dictionary is not profiled. (ZyX, 2010 Dec 25)

Add script number to profile?  (#3330 breaks tests).

Patch for Neovim concerning restoring when closing help window. (glacambre
neovim #7431)

Patch for improving detecting Ruby on Mac in configure. (Ilya Mikhaltsou, 2017
Nov 21)

When t_Co is changed from termresponse, the OptionSet autocommand event isn't
triggered.  Use the code from the end of set_num_option() in
set_color_count().

Add another autocommand like TermResponse that is fired for the other terminal
responses, such as bg and fg.  Use "bg", "fg", "blink", etc. for the name.

When using command line window, CmdlineLeave is triggered without
CmdlineEnter.  (xtal8, 2017 Oct 30, #2263)
Add some way to get the nested state.  Although CmdwinEnter is obviously
always nested.

matchit hasn't been maintained for a long time.  #955.

Problem with 'delcombine'. (agguser, 2017 Nov 10, #2313)

'delcombine' does not work for the command line. (Tony Mechelynck, 2009 Jul

MS-Windows: buffer completion doesn't work when using backslash (or slash)
for a path separator. (xtal8, #2201)

Would be nice for Insert mode completion to highlight the text that was added
(and may change when picking another completion).

Test more runtime files.

Window not closed when deleting buffer. (Harm te Hennepe, 2017 Aug 27, #2029)

Add options_default() / options_restore() to set several options to Vim
defaults for a plugin. Comments from Zyx, 2017 May 10.
Perhaps use a vimcontext / endvimcontext command block.

After using :noautocmd CursorMoved may still trigger. (Andy Stewart, 2017 Sep
13, #2084).  Set old position after the command.

When bracketed paste is used, pasting at the ":append" prompt does not get the
line breaks. (Ken Takata, 2017 Aug 22)

Cannot copy modeless selection when cursor is inside it. (lkintact, #2300)

Test_writefile_fails_conversion failure on Solaris because if different iconv

X11: Putting more than about 262040 characters of text on the clipboard and
pasting it in another Vim doesn't work.  (Dominique Pelle, 2008 Aug 21-23)
clip_x11_request_selection_cb() is called with zero value and length.
Also: Get an error message from free() in the process that owns the selection.
Seems to happen when the selection is requested the second time, but before
clip_x11_convert_selection_cb() is invoked, thus in X library code.
Kazunobu Kuriyama is working on a proper fix. (2017 Jul 25)

Problem with three-piece comment. (Michael Lee, 2017 May 11, #1696)

Creating a partial with an autoload function is confused about the "self"

Also fixes #2166?

Profile of a dict function is lost when the dict is deleted.  Would it be
possible to collect this?  (Daniel Hahler, #2350)

When checking if a bufref is valid, also check the buffer number, to catch the
case of :bwipe followed by :new.

Patch to skip writing a temp file for diffing if the buffer is equal to the
existing file. (Akria Sheng, 2017 Jul 22)
Could also skip writing lines that are the same.

MS-Windows: Opening same file in a second gvim hangs. (Sven Bruggemann, 2017

Setting 'clipboard' to "unnamed" makes a global command very slow (Daniel
Drucker, 2017 May 8).
This was supposed to be fixed, did it break again somehow?
Christian cannot reproduce it.

Using composing char in mapping does not work properly. maparg() shows the
wrong thing. (Nikolai Pavlov, 2017 Jul 8, #1827)
Or is this not an actual problem?

Better TeX indent file. (Christian Brabandt, 2017 May 3)

Use gvimext.dll from the nightly build? (Issue #249)

'synmaxcol' works with bytes instead of screen cells. (Llandon, 2017 May 31,
#1736)

Problem with using :cd when remotely editing a file. (Gerd Wachsmuth, 2017 May
8, #1690)

Memory leak in test97?  The string is actually freed.  Weird.

assert_fails() can only check for the first error.  Make it possible to have
it catch multiple errors and check all of them.

Add a toolbar in the terminal.  Can be global, above all windows, or specific
for one window.

Make maparg() also return the raw rhs, so that it doesn't depend on 'cpo'.
(Brett Stahlman, 2017 May 23)
Even better: add a way to disable a mapping temporarily and re-enable it
later.  This is for a sub-mode that is active for a short while (one buffer).
Still need maplist() to find the mappings.  What can we use to identify a
mapping?  Something unique would be better than the LHS.
Perhaps simpler: actually delete the mappings.  Use maplist() to list matching
mappings (with a lhs prefix, like maparg()), mapdelete() to delete,
maprestore() to restore (using the output of maplist()).

Add an argument to :mkvimrc (or add another command) to skip mappings from
plugins (source is a Vim script).  No need to put these in a .vimrc, they will
be defined when the plugin is loaded.

Use tb_set(winid, [{'text': 'stop', 'cb': callback, 'hi': 'Green'}])
    tb_highlight(winid, 'ToolBar')

Using CTRL-G_U in InsertCharPre causes trouble for redo. (Israel Chauca
Fuentes, 2017 Feb 12, #1470)

Add a "keytrans()" function, which turns the internal byte representation of a
key into a form that can be used for :map.  E.g.
    let xx = "\<C-Home>"
    echo keytrans(xx)
    <C-Home>

Check for errors E704 and E705 only does VAR_FUNC, should also do VAR_PARTIAL.
(Nikolai Pavlov, 2017 Mar 13, #1557)
Make a function to check for function-like type?

Implement named arguments for functions with optional arguments:
    func Foo(start, count = 1, all = 1)
    call Foo(12, all = 0)

Add a command to take a range of lines, filter them and put the output
somewhere else.  :{range}copy {dest} !cmd

The TermResponse event is not triggered when a plugin has set 'eventignore' to
"all".  Netrw does this. (Gary Johnson, 2017 Jan 24)
Postpone the event until 'eventignore' is reset.

Expanding /**/ is slow.  Idea by Luc Hermitte, 2017 Apr 14.

Once .exe with updated installer is available: Add remark to download page

Or point to nightly builds: https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases

":sbr" docs state it respects 'switchbuf', but "vsplit" does not cause a
vertical split. (Haldean Brown, 2017 Mar 1)

Use ADDR_OTHER instead of ADDR_LINES for many more commands.
E.g. all the location list commands use a count.
Add tests for using number larger than number of lines in buffer.

Might be useful to have isreadonly(), like we have islocked().
Avoids exceptions, e.g. when using the b: namespace as a dict.

Patch to make v:shell_error writable. (Christian Brabandt, 2016 Sep 27)
Useful to restore it.  Is there another solution?

Patch for wrong cursor position on wrapped line, involving breakindent.
(Ozaki Kiichi, 2016 Nov 25)

Patch for 'cursorlinenr' option. (Ozaki Kiichi, 2016 Nov 30)

Window resizing with 'winfixheight': With a vertical split the height changes
anyway. (Tommy allen, 2017 Feb 21, #1502)

Invalid behavior with NULL list. (Nikolai Pavlov, #768)
E.g. deepcopy(test_null_list())

Patch to make it possible to extend a list with itself.
(Nikolai Pavlov, 2016 Sep 23)

Patch to add Zstandard compressed file support. (Nick Terrell, 2016 Oct 24)

On Windows buffer completion sees backslash as escape char instead of path
separator. (Toffanim, 2016 Nov 24, #1274)

Should :vmap in matchit.vim be :xmap?  (Tony Mechelynck)

Problem with whitespace in errorformat. (Gerd Wachsmuth, 2016 May 15, #807)

Support sort(l, 'F'), convert strings to float. (#7857)

sort() is not stable when using numeric/float sort (Nikolay Pavlov, 2016 Sep
4#1038)

sort() does not use 'smartcase' for the skip pattern, even though 'ignorecase'
is used. (Filipe Brandenburger, #7322)

+channel:
- Add a in_cb, invoked when the write buffer has become empty. (Matteo Landi)
- Add ch_readlines(): for a channel in NL mode, reads as many lines as are
  available.  Should be more efficient than looping over ch_read() with
  ch_status() to check for more.
- If buffer contents is changed in a callback, set w_redr_status so that it
  gets redrawn in redraw_after_callback(). #6120
- Add a separate timeout for opening a socket.  Currently it's fixed at 50
  msec, which is too small for a remote connection. (tverniquet, #2130)
- Writing raw mode to a buffer should still handle NL characters as line
  breaks. (Dmitry Zotikov, 2017 Aug 16)
- When out_cb executes :sleep, the close_cb may be invoked. (Daniel Hahler,
  2016 Dec 11, #1320)
- Implement |job-term| ?
- Calling a function when receiving a "call" on a channel, using feedkeys()
  does not work.  It does work from a timer. (Qiming Zhao, #3852)
- Channel test fails with Motif.  Sometimes kills the X11 server.
- When a message in the queue but there is no callback, drop it after a while?
  Add timestamp to queued messages and callbacks with ID, remove after a
  minute.  Option to set the droptime.
- Add an option to drop text of very long lines?  Default to 1 Mbyte.
- Add remark about undo sync, is there a way to force it?
- When starting a job, have an option to open the server socket, so we know
  the port, and pass it to the command with --socket-fd {nr}. (Olaf Dabrunz,
  Feb 9)  How to do this on MS-Windows?
- For connection to server, a "keep open" flag would be useful.  Retry
  connecting in the main loop with zero timeout.
- job_start(): run job in a newly opened terminal (not a terminal window).
    With xterm could use -S{pty}.
    Although user could use "xterm -e 'cmd arg'".

Regexp problems:
- NFA engine can be slow for some patterns.  Dominique found out that most
  time is spent in addstate_here() copying the threads.  Instead of copying,
  let each thread point to the next one (by offset, the list is reallocated).
  (Dominique Pelle, 2019 Feb 18)
- Old engine: using 'incsearch' /\Zabc does not highlight the "c" if it has a
  composing character.  New engine is OK. (Tony Mechelynck, 2019 May 5)
- When search pattern has the base character both with and without combining
  character, search fails.  E.g. "รรีบ" in "การรีบรักใคร". (agguser, #2312)
- [:space:] only matches ASCII spaces.  Add [:white:] for all space-like
  characters, esp. including 0xa0.  Use character class zero.
- Since 7.4.704 the old regex engine fails to match [[:print:]] in 0xf6.
  (Manuel Ortega, 2016 Apr 24)
  Test fails on Mac.  Avoid using isalpha(), isalnum(), etc?  Depends on
  LC_CTYPE
- The old engine does not find a match for "/\%#=1\(\)\{80}", the new engine
  matches everywhere.
- Using win_linetabsize() can still be slow. Cache the result, store col and
  vcol. Reset them when moving to another line.
- Very slow with a long line and Ruby highlighting. (John Whitley, 2014 Dec 4)
- Bug with pattern: '\vblock (\d+)\.\n.*\d+%(\1)@<!\.$'
  (Lech Lorens, 2014 Feb 3)
- Issue 164: freeze on regexp search.
- Ignorecase not handled properly for multibyte characters. (Axel Bender,
  2013 Dec 11)
- Using \@> and \?. (Brett Stahlman, 2013 Dec 21) Remark from Marcin
  Szamotulski; Remark from Brett 2014 Jan 6 and 7.
- NFA regexp doesn't handle \%<v correctly. (Ingo Karkat, 2014 May 12)
- Does not work with NFA regexp engine:
  \%u, \%x, \%o, \%d followed by a composing character
- Search for \%d0\+ may fail with E363. (Christian Brabandt, 2016 Oct 4)
- \%'[ does not work.  '%'] does work.  (Masaaki Nakamura, 2016 Apr 4)
- Bug relating to back references. (Ingo Karkat, 2014 Jul 24)
- New RE does not give an error for empty group: "\(\)\{2}" (Dominique Pelle,
  2015 Feb 7)
- Using back reference before the capturing group sometimes works with the old
  engine, can we do this with the new engine?  E.g. with
  "/\%(<\1>\)\@<=.*\%(<\/\(\w\+\)>\)\@=" matching text inside HTML tags.
  This problem is probably the same: "\%(^\1.*$\n\)\@<=\(\d\+\).*$".
  (guotuofeng, 2015 Jun 22)
- Strange matching with "\(Hello\n\)\@<=A". (Anas Syed, 2015 Feb 12)
- Problem with \v(A)@<=b+\1c. (Issue 334)
- Diff highlighting can be very slow. (Issue 309)
- Using %> for a virtual column has a check based on 'tabsize'.  Better would
  be to cache the result of win_linetabsize(col), storing both col and vcol,
  and use them to decide whether win_linetabsize() needs to be called.  Reset
  col and vcol when moving to another line.
- this doesn't work: "syntax match ErrorMsg /.\%9l\%>20c\&\%<28c/".  Leaving
  out the \& works.  Seems any column check after \& fails.
- Difference between two engines: ".*\zs\/\@>\/" on text "///"
  (Chris Paul, 2016 Nov 13)  New engine not greedy enough?
  Another one: echom matchstr(" sdfsfsf\n sfdsdfsdf",'[^\n]*')
  (2017 May 15, #1252)

Idea from Sven: record sequence of keys.  Useful to show others what they are
doing (look over the shoulder), and also to see what happened.
Probably list of keystrokes, with some annotations for mode changes.
Could store in logfile to be able to analyse it with an external command.
E.g. to see when's the last time a plugin command was used.

Jul 25, #948)

Patch to add 'systemencoding', convert between 'encoding' and this for file
names, shell commands and the like.  (Kikuchan, 2010 Oct 14)
Assume the system converts between the actual encoding of the filesystem to
the system encoding (usually utf-8).

MS-Windows: use WS_HIDE instead of SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE in os_win32.c?
Otherwise task flickers in taskbar.

Second problem in #966: ins_compl_add_tv() uses get_dict_string() multiple
times, overwrites the one buffer. (Nikolay Pavlov, 2016 Aug 5)

Patch to improve map documentation. Issue #799.

We can use '. to go to the last change in the current buffer, but how about
the last change in any buffer?  Can we use ', (, is next to .)?

Ramel Eshed: system() is much slower than job_start(), why? (Aug 26)

When generating the Unicode tables with runtime/tools/unicode.vim the
emoji_width table has only one entry.

It's possible to add ",," to 'wildignore', an empty entry.  Causes problems.
Reject the value? #710.

When doing "vi buf.md" a BufNew autocommand for *.md is not triggered.
Because of using the initial buffer? (Dun Peal, 2016 May 12)

Zero-out krypt key information when no longer in use. (Ben Fritz, 2017 May 15)

Add stronger encryption.  Could use libsodium (NaCl).
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/
Possibly include the needed code so that it can be built everywhere.

Add a way to restart a timer.  It's similar to timer_stop() and timer_start(),
but the reference remains valid.

Need to try out instructions in INSTALLpc.txt about how to install all

Patch to make tests pass with EBCDIC. (Owen Leibman, 2016 Apr 10)

Add ":read :command", to insert the output of an Ex command?
Can already do it with ":$put =execute('command')".

exists(":tearoff") does not tell you if the command is implemented. (Tony
Mechelynck)  Perhaps use exists("::tearoff") to check?

Use vim.vim syntax highlighting for help file examples, but without ":" in
'iskeyword' for syntax.

Installation of .desktop files does not work everywhere.
It's now fixed, but the target directory probably isn't right.
Add configure check?
Should use /usr/local/share/applications or /usr/share/applications.
Or use $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
Also need to run update-desktop-database (Kuriyama Kazunobu, 2015 Nov 4)

Test object i{ and it do not behave the same. #1379
Do not include the linebreak at the start?

Feature request: add the "al" text object, to manipulate a screen line.
Especially useful when using 'linebreak'

Instead of separately uploading patches to the ftp site, we can get them from
github with a URL like this:
   https://github.com/vim/vim/compare/v7.4.920%5E...v7.4.920.diff
Diff for version.c contains more context, can't skip a patch.

Python: ":py raw_input('prompt')" doesn't work. (Manu Hack)

Comparing nested structures with "==" uses a different comparator than when
comparing individual items.

Using uninitialized memory. (Dominique Pelle, 2015 Nov 4)

MS-Windows: When editing a file with a leading space, writing it uses the
wrong name. (Aram, 2014 Nov 7)  Vim 7.4.

Can't recognize the $ProgramFiles(x86) environment variable.  Recognize it
specifically?  First try with the parens, then without.

Patch to add :mapgroup, put mappings in a group like augroup.
(Yasuhiro Matsumoto, 2016 Feb 19)

Can we cache the syntax attributes, so that updates for 'relativenumber' and
'cursorline'/'cursorcolumn' are a lot faster?  Thus store the attributes
before combining them.

C highlighting: modern C allows: /* comment */ #ifdef
and also line continuation after #include.
I can't recommend it though.

Build with Python on Mac does not always use the right library.
(Kazunobu Kuriyama, 2015 Mar 28)

To support Thai (and other languages) word boundaries, include the ICU

MS-Windows: Crash opening very long file name starting with "\\".
(Christian Brock, 2012 Jun 29)

The OptionSet autocommand event is not always triggered. (Rick Howe, 2015 Sep
24): :diffthis, :diffoff.

":set all&" still does not handle all side effects.  Centralize handling side
effects for when set by the user, on init and when reset to default.

":tag" does not jump to the right entry of a :tselect. (James Speros, 2015 Oct
9)

The argument for "-S" is not taken literally, the ":so" command expands
wildcards.  Add a ":nowild" command modifier?  (ZyX, 2015 March 4)

Proposal to make options.txt easier to read. (Arnaud Decara, 2015 Aug 5)
Update Aug 14.

When using --remote-tab on MS-Windows 'encoding' hasn't been initialized yet,
the file name ends up encoded wrong. (Raul Coronado, 2015 Dec 21)

Example in editing.txt uses $HOME with the expectation that it ends in a
slash.  For me it does, but perhaps not for everybody.  Add a function that
inserts a slash when needed?  pathconcat(dir, path) (Thilo Six, 2015 Aug 12)

ml_updatechunk() is slow when retrying for another encoding. (John Little,
2014 Sep 11)

'showbreak' text as part of the operation. (Axel Bender, 2015 Jul 20)

Patch to add grepfile(). (Scott Prager, 2015 May 26)
Work in progress.

Would be useful to have a treemap() or deepmap() function.  Like map() but
when an item is a list or dict would recurse into it.

Patch for global-local options consistency. (Arnaud Decara, 2015 Jul 22)
Is this right?

Patch to make getregtype() return the right size for non-linux systems.

Result of systemlist() does not show whether text ended in line break.
(Bjorn Linse, 2014 Nov 27)

When in 'comments' "n:x" follows after three-part comment directly it repeats
any one-character from the previous line. (Kartik Agaram, 2014 Sep 19)

Patch for glob(), adding slash to normal files. (Ingo Karkat, 2014 Dec 22)

When entering and leaving the preview window autocommands are triggered, but
these may not work well.  Perhaps set a flag to indicate that the preview
window is involved? (John Otter, 2015 Oct 27)

Using "." to repeat an Ex command puts that command in history.  Probably
should not happen.  If the command is the result of a mapping it's not put in
history either. (Jacob Niehus, 2014 Nov 2)
Patch from Jacob, Nov 2.

"hi link" does not respect groups with GUI settings only. (Mark Lodato, 2014
