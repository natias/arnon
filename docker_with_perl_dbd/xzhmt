Patch 6.2f.021
Problem:    Running configure with "--enable-netbeans" disables Netbeans.
	    (Gordon Prieur)

Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/mysign

Patch 6.2f.022
Problem:    A bogus value for 'foldmarker' is not rejected, possibly causing a
	    hang. (Derek Wyatt)
Solution:   Check for a non-empty string before and after the comma.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2f.023
Problem:    When the help files are not in $VIMRUNTIME but 'helpfile' is
	    correct Vim still can't find the help files.
Solution:   Also look for a tags file in the directory of 'helpfile'.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2f.024

	    composing characters "x" deletes them all.
Solution:   Always delete only the last composing character.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2f.025
Problem:    When reading a file from stdin that has DOS line endings but a
	    missing end-of-line for the last line 'fileformat' becomes "unix".
	    (Bill McCarthy)
Solution:   Don't add the missing line break when re-reading the text from the
	    buffer.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2f.026

Patch 6.2f.028
Problem:    GTK: When 'imactivatekey' is empty and XIM is inactive it can't be
	    made active again.  Cursor isn't updated immediately when changing
	    XIM activation.  Japanese XIM may hang when using 'imactivatekey'.
	    Can't activate XIM after typing fFtT command or ":sh".
Solution:   Properly set the flag that indicates the IM is active.  Update the
	    cursor right away.  Do not send a key-release event.  Handle
	    Normal mode and running an external command differently.
	    (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2f.029

Patch 6.2f.033
Problem:    Cscope: re-entrance problem for ":cscope" command.  Checking for
	    duplicate database didn't work well for Win95.  Didn't check for
	    duplicate databases after an empty entry.
Solution:   Don't set postponed_split too early.  Remember first empty
	    database entry. (Sergey Khorev)
Files:	    src/if_cscope.c

Patch 6.2f.034
Problem:    The netbeans interface cannot be used on systems without

Patch 6.2f.037
Problem:    When receiving a Netbeans command at the hit-enter or more prompt
	    the screen is redrawn but Vim is still waiting at the prompt.
Solution:   Quit the prompt like a CTRL-C was typed.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2f.038
Problem:    The dependency to run autoconf causes a patch for configure.in
	    to run autoconf, even though the configure script was updated as
	    well.
Solution:   Only run autoconf with "make autoconf".
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2f.039
Problem:    CTRL-W K makes the new top window very high.
Solution:   When 'equalalways' is set equalize the window heights.
Files:	    src/window.c


==============================================================================
VERSION 6.3						*version-6.3*

This section is about improvements made between version 6.2 and 6.3.

This is mainly a bug-fix release.  There are also a few new features.
The major number of new items is in the runtime files and translations.


Changed							*changed-6.3*
-------

The intro message also displays a note about sponsoring Vim, mixed randomly
with the message about helping children in Uganda.

Included the translated menus, keymaps and tutors with the normal runtime
files.  The separate "lang" archive now only contains translated messages.

Made the translated menu file names a bit more consistent.  Use "latin1" for
"iso_8859-1" and "iso_8859-15".

Removed the "file_select.vim" script from the distribution.  It's not more
useful than other scripts that can be downloaded from www.vim.org.

The "runtime/doc/tags" file is now always in unix fileformat.  On MS-Windows
it used to be dos fileformat, but ":helptags" generates a unix format file.

Python version 2.3 is used.  For Perl version 5.8 is used.

The "ftdetect" directory is mentioned in the documentation.  The DOS install
program creates it.

here and there.  (Walter Briscoe)

The explorer plugin didn't work for double-byte 'encoding's.
