<h4>Committing the result of large merges
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#fewer-ood-conditions"

</h4>

<p>Our best practices suggest that projects should branch and merge
at the project root level.  Each merge will then usually change the
<tt>svn:mergeinfo</tt> property at the project base folder.  To commit
that change, pre-1.9 servers require the client to have the latest
version of that base folder.  Whenever there is a commit in that tree,
its base folder will get a new revision as well, though.   Thus, in
large, busy projects, it is likely that by the time a large merge commit
would actually have reached its finalization phase, some other commit
got through and the merge commit is rejected for being out of date.  
</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 now allows to modify directory properties based on
old revisions as long as the directory contents itself did no change.
Directory contents changes would either be property changes,  added or
removed entries.  Sub-tree or file contents changes no longer prevent
the property change from going through.  Of course, true file and tree
change conflicts will still result in out-of-date errors.
</p>

<p>This new behavior is not restricted to <tt>svn:mergeinfo</tt> changes
but applies to any directory properties.  Changes to <tt>svn:ignore</tt>
are another common scenario previously prone to update / commit /
out-of-date races.

<h3>Three-way conflict display, and <tt>diff3</tt> enhancements

</h3>
  
<p>When a text conflict occurs (and is not resolved by the interactive conflicts
resolver during <tt>svn update</tt>, <tt>svn switch</tt> or <tt>svn merge</tt>),
<em>conflicts markers</em> are written into the conflicted file.  Previous versions
of Subversion would render conflict markers as follows:</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
   Contents of the file in the working copy (including local modifications)
   =======
   Contents of the file in the revision being updated to
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>As of Subversion 1.9, conflict markers would be rendered with information on
the base (called "older" in diff3 parlance):</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
   Contents of the file in the working copy (including local modifications)
   ||||||| .r1
   Contents of the file in the working copy's BASE revision
   =======
   Contents of the file in the revision being updated to
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>Here, one resolves the conflict by manually applying to the
<tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt> hunk the same changes that would transform
the <tt>|||||||</tt> hunk into the <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> hunk.
For example, the following conflict:</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
   "Hello hello, world!"
   ||||||| .r1
   "Hello, world!"
   =======
   "Hello, ${name}!"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>should be resolved to:</p>

<pre>
   Unconflicted lines
   "Hello hello, ${name}!"
   Unconflicted lines
</pre>

<p>The three-way conflict display was already used by property conflicts and
by the interactive conflicts resolver in previous releases of Subversion.</p>

<p>The old, two-way conflict markers output can be obtained by setting
<tt>diff3-cmd</tt> in the <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.confarea.html"
>Subversion runtime configuration</a> (or via the <tt>--config-option</tt>
or <tt>--diff3-cmd</tt> command-line options) to a <tt>diff3</tt>
command that generates two-way conflict markers.  Your system may already
include such a <tt>diff3</tt> program; one is also included with Subversion
and can be installed via <tt>make install-tools</tt> (Unix) or by building the
<tt>diff3</tt> or <tt>__MORE__</tt> targets (Windows).  On a typical Unix system,
simply setting <tt>diff3-cmd=diff3</tt> will restore two-way conflict markers.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 adds to the included <tt>diff3</tt> program
a <tt>--conflict-style</tt> marker that can be used to explicitly choose among
two-way conflict markers, three-way conflict markers, and a few other options.
That program can be used independently of Subversion anywhere a <tt>diff3</tt>
command is needed.</p>

<p>The <tt>blame</tt> command can now show not only when the <em>last</em>
change to each line of a given file was, but also when the <em>next</em> change
will be.</p>

<p>For example, to see for each line in revision&nbsp;3 of README.txt what the
next revision that changed (or removed) that line would be, run
<tt>svn blame -r HEAD:3 README.txt</tt>.  (You may need to pass a

<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.pegrevs.html">peg
revision</a> if the file had been renamed since r3.)</p>

<p>In the <tt>blame</tt> command, the range <tt>-r&nbsp;M:N</tt> always means
"display information about the file at revision&nbsp;N".  If the range is
"forward" (M&lt;N) then the normal blame algorithm is used, displaying for each
line in the file when it was added or last changed; if the range is "reversed"
(M&gt;N) then the above-described sense is used, describing for each line in rN
when it was first changed (or deleted) after rN and before rM.</p>

<p>Here is an example, from Subversion's own repository.  The autoconf macro
<tt>SVN_CHECK_FOR_DUNDER_BUILTINS</tt> was
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/build/ac-macros/svn-macros.m4?view=markup&amp;pathrev=1509167#l167"

command can determine the revision in which the macro was removed:</p>

<pre>
% svn blame -r HEAD:1509167 svn-macros.m4
&vellip;
1509168   danielsh AC_DEFUN([SVN_CHECK_FOR_DUNDER_BUILTINS],

<p>And indeed, <tt>svn diff -c r1509168</tt> shows that revision

<p>When locking, or unlocking, multiple files in a single operation
over HTTP the client will use HTTP pipelining for the individual

<h3>Locking multiple files
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#locking-multiple-files"

<p>Subversion locks, the locks that prevent commits from other working
copies, are stored in the repository. When adding or removing locks
the FSFS backend can now operate on several locks at once.  This
reduces the amount of disk IO when handling multiple locks and is
significant when the total number of locks in the repository is large,
100,000 say.</p>

<p>The default behaviour for commits is to automatically release locks
after a successful commit and this takes advantage of the more
efficient lock process.  In previous releases the disk IO involved in
releasing the locks would sometimes be greater than that involved in
creating the new revision.</p>

<p>Clients using the svn:// protocol will also benefit from the more
efficient lock handling when locking or unlocking multiple files in a
single operation.  Clients using HTTP will not get this benefit since
the client still sends multiple, pipelined, LOCK and UNLOCK requests,
one for each file.</p>

</p>

<p>It has always been possible, in atypical cases, for a commit to mark a
file as 'changed' without actually changing the file's text and/or
properties to a different value. Starting from 1.9.0, <tt>svnadmin dump</tt>
still outputs a record for such a file, including a header saying that the
action is 'change', but no longer appends a block describing the new text
for the file. (And similarly for properties, perhaps? TBD.) When
<tt>svnadmin load</tt> (1.8 or 1.9) reads this dumpfile, it does not record
any change in the repository for such a file.
</p>

<p>One user-visible effect is that, after dump and load, 'svn log -v' will
no longer list the path of such a file in its list of 'changed paths'.

</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.9.0 introduces the use of HTTP pipelining for locking/unlocking
multiple files. While SVN detects whether HTTP pipelining is supported (and
falls back to non HTTP pipelining mode, if it isn't), issues can arrise, if
there are flaws or bugs with any of the protocols/applications involved in
processing pipelined HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Especially, if there are older proxies present in the network topology, it's
possible that you run into issues, since being a technology which was
introduced in HTTP/1.1 (and the full performance benefit is not expected unless
you are using HTTP/2), this feature might have not been extensively tested by
your proxy vendor.</p>

<p>To troubleshoot whether the proxy is causing an issue, try to lock/unlock
multiple files bypassing the proxy. If that works, please get in touch with
the proxy vendor to notify him about the problem and ask for support.</p>

<p>It's also appreciated, if you would let the SVN developers know about the
effected proxy via the users mailing list so this troubleshooting section can

<h2>Subversion 1.7.x series no longer supported
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#svn-1.7-deprecation"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>The Subversion 1.7.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't
mean that your 1.7 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all
you need, that's fine.  "No longer supported" just means we've stopped
accepting bug reports against 1.7.x versions, and will not make any
more 1.7.x bugfix releases.</p>

    # Tell ucf that the file in /usr/share/foo is the latest
    # maintainer version, and let it handle how to manage the real
    # confuguration file in /etc. This is how a static configuration
    # file can be handled:
    ucf /usr/share/foo/configuration /etc/foo.conf
    ucfr foo /etc/foo.conf

    ### We could also do this on the fly. The following is from Tore
    ### Anderson:

    #. /usr/share/debconf/confmodule

    ### find out what the user answered.
    #  db_get foo/run_on_boot
    #  run_on_boot=$RET
    #  db_stop

    ### safely create a temporary file to generate our suggested
    ### configuration file.
    #    tempfile=`tempfile`
    #    cat << _eof > $tempfile
    ### Configuration file for Foo.

    ### this was answered by you, the user in a debconf dialogue
    #  RUNONBOOT=$run_on_boot

    ### this was not, as it has a sane default value.
    #  COLOUROFSKY=blue

    #_eof

    ### Note that some versions of debconf do not release stdin, so
    ### the following invocation of ucf may not work, since the stdin
    ### is never connected to ucfr.

    ### now, invoke ucf, which will take care of the rest, and ask
    ### the user if he wants to update his file, if it is modified.
    #ucf $tempfile /etc/foo.conf

    ### done! now we'll just clear up our cruft.
    #rm -f $tempfile
