=item * A Filename

If C<$output> is a filename and C<Append> is enabled, the file will be
opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the file, if any, will be
truncated before any compressed data is written to it.

=item * A Filehandle

If C<$output> is a filehandle, the file pointer will be positioned to the
end of the file via a call to C<seek> before any compressed data is written
to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be moved.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item C<< Merge => 0|1 >>

This option is used to compress input data and append it to an existing
compressed data stream in C<$output>. The end result is a single compressed
data stream stored in C<$output>.

It is a fatal error to attempt to use this option when C<$output> is not an
RFC 1950 data stream.

There are a number of other limitations with the C<Merge> option:

=over 5

=item 1

This module needs to have been built with zlib 1.2.1 or better to work. A
fatal error will be thrown if C<Merge> is used with an older version of
zlib.

=item 2

If C<$output> is a file or a filehandle, it must be seekable.

=back

This parameter defaults to 0.

=item -Level

Defines the compression level used by zlib. The value should either be
a number between 0 and 9 (0 means no compression and 9 is maximum
compression), or one of the symbolic constants defined below.

   Z_NO_COMPRESSION
   Z_BEST_SPEED
   Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
   Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

The default is Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

Note, these constants are not imported by C<IO::Compress::Deflate> by default.

    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:strategy);
    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:constants);
    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:all);

=item -Strategy

Defines the strategy used to tune the compression. Use one of the symbolic
constants defined below.

   Z_FILTERED
   Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
   Z_RLE
   Z_FIXED
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

The default is Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY.

=item C<< Strict => 0|1 >>

This is a placeholder option.

=back

=head2 Examples

=head3 Streaming

This very simple command line example demonstrates the streaming capabilities
of the module. The code reads data from STDIN or all the files given on the
commandline, compresses it, and writes the compressed data to STDOUT.

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(deflate $DeflateError) ;

    my $z = IO::Compress::Deflate->new("-", Stream => 1)
        or die "IO::Compress::Deflate failed: $DeflateError\n";

    while (<>) {
        $z->print("abcde");
    }
    $z->close();

Note the use of C<"-"> to means C<STDOUT>. Alternatively you can use C<\*STDOUT>.

=head3 Compressing a file from the filesystem

To read the contents of the file C<file1.txt> and write the compressed
data to the file C<file1.txt.1950> there are a few options

Start by creating the compression object and opening the input file

    use strict ;
    use warnings ;
    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(deflate $DeflateError) ;

    my $input = "file1.txt";
    my $z = IO::Compress::Deflate->new("file1.txt.1950")
        or die "IO::Compress::Deflate failed: $DeflateError\n";

    # open the input file
    open my $fh, "<", "file1.txt"
        or die "Cannot open file1.txt: $!\n";

    # loop through the input file & write to the compressed file
    while (<$fh>) {
        $z->print($_);
    }

    # not forgetting to close the compressed file
    $z->close();

=head1 Methods

=head2 print

Usage is

    $z->print($data)
    print $z $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter. This
has the same behaviour as the C<print> built-in.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 printf

Usage is

    $z->printf($format, $data)
    printf $z $format, $data

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns true if successful.

=head2 syswrite

Usage is

    $z->syswrite $data
    $z->syswrite $data, $length
    $z->syswrite $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 write

Usage is

    $z->write $data
    $z->write $data, $length
    $z->write $data, $length, $offset

Compresses and outputs the contents of the C<$data> parameter.

Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or C<undef> if
unsuccessful.

=head2 flush

Usage is

    $z->flush;
    $z->flush($flush_type);

Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

This method takes an optional parameter, C<$flush_type>, that controls
how the flushing will be carried out. By default the C<$flush_type>
used is C<Z_FINISH>. Other valid values for C<$flush_type> are
C<Z_NO_FLUSH>, C<Z_SYNC_FLUSH>, C<Z_FULL_FLUSH> and C<Z_BLOCK>. It is
strongly recommended that you only set the C<flush_type> parameter if
you fully understand the implications of what it does - overuse of C<flush>
can seriously degrade the level of compression achieved. See the C<zlib>
documentation for details.

Returns true on success.

=head2 tell

Usage is

    $z->tell()
    tell $z

Returns the uncompressed file offset.

=head2 eof

Usage is

    $z->eof();
    eof($z);

Returns true if the C<close> method has been called.

=head2 seek

    $z->seek($position, $whence);
    seek($z, $position, $whence);

Provides a sub-set of the C<seek> functionality, with the restriction
that it is only legal to seek forward in the output file/buffer.
It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to them.

The C<$whence> parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

=head2 binmode

Usage is

    $z->binmode
    binmode $z ;

This is a noop provided for completeness.

=head2 opened

    $z->opened()

Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer.

=head2 autoflush

    my $prev = $z->autoflush()
    my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
C<EXPR> is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
write/print operation.

If C<$z> is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
returns C<undef>.

B<Note> that the special variable C<$|> B<cannot> be used to set or
retrieve the autoflush setting.

=head2 input_line_number

    $z->input_line_number()
    $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

This method always returns C<undef> when compressing.

=head2 fileno

    $z->fileno()
    fileno($z)

If the C<$z> object is associated with a file or a filehandle, C<fileno>
will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the C<close> method is
called C<fileno> will return C<undef>.

If the C<$z> object is associated with a buffer, this method will return
C<undef>.

=head2 close

    $z->close() ;
    close $z ;

Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output file/buffer.

For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
the IO::Compress::Deflate object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In
these cases, the C<close> method will be called automatically, but
not until global destruction of all live objects when the program is
terminating.

Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
of Perl, you should call C<close> explicitly and not rely on automatic
closing.

Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

If the C<AutoClose> option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::Deflate
object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
underlying file will also be closed.

=head2 newStream([OPTS])

Usage is

    $z->newStream( [OPTS] )

Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

OPTS consists of any of the options that are available when creating
the C<$z> object.

See the L</"Constructor Options"> section for more details.

=head2 deflateParams

Usage is

    $z->deflateParams

TODO

=head1 Importing

A number of symbolic constants are required by some methods in
C<IO::Compress::Deflate>. None are imported by default.

=over 5

=item :all

constants that can be used by C<IO::Compress::Deflate>. Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(deflate $DeflateError :constants) ;

=item :constants

Import all symbolic constants. Same as doing this

    use IO::Compress::Deflate qw(:flush :level :strategy) ;

=item :flush

These symbolic constants are used by the C<flush> method.

=head1 NAME

IO::Compress::FAQ -- Frequently Asked Questions about IO::Compress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Common questions answered.

=head1 GENERAL

=head2 Compatibility with Unix compress/uncompress.

Although C<Compress::Zlib> has a pair of functions called C<compress> and
C<uncompress>, they are I<not> related to the Unix programs of the same
name. The C<Compress::Zlib> module is not compatible with Unix
C<compress>.

If you have the C<uncompress> program available, you can use this to read
compressed files

    open F, "uncompress -c $filename |";
    while (<F>)
    {
        ...

Alternatively, if you have the C<gunzip> program available, you can use
this to read compressed files

    open F, "gunzip -c $filename |";
    while (<F>)
    {
        ...

and this to write compress files, if you have the C<compress> program
available

    open F, "| compress -c $filename ";
    print F "data";
    ...
    close F ;

=head2 Accessing .tar.Z files

The C<Archive::Tar> module can optionally use C<Compress::Zlib> (via the
C<IO::Zlib> module) to access tar files that have been compressed with
C<gzip>. Unfortunately tar files compressed with the Unix C<compress>
utility cannot be read by C<Compress::Zlib> and so cannot be directly
accessed by C<Archive::Tar>.

If the C<uncompress> or C<gunzip> programs are available, you can use one
of these workarounds to read C<.tar.Z> files from C<Archive::Tar>

Firstly with C<uncompress>

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Archive::Tar;

    open F, "uncompress -c $filename |";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
    ...

and this with C<gunzip>

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Archive::Tar;

    open F, "gunzip -c $filename |";
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
    ...

Similarly, if the C<compress> program is available, you can use this to
write a C<.tar.Z> file

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Archive::Tar;
    use IO::File;

    my $fh = IO::File->new( "| compress -c >$filename" );
    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new();
    ...
    $tar->write($fh);
    $fh->close ;

=head2 How do I recompress using a different compression?

This is easier that you might expect if you realise that all the
C<IO::Compress::*> objects are derived from C<IO::File> and that all the
C<IO::Uncompress::*> modules can read from an C<IO::File> filehandle.

So, for example, say you have a file compressed with gzip that you want to
recompress with bzip2. Here is all that is needed to carry out the
recompression.

    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip ':all';
    use IO::Compress::Bzip2 ':all';

    my $gzipFile = "somefile.gz";
    my $bzipFile = "somefile.bz2";

    my $gunzip = IO::Uncompress::Gunzip->new( $gzipFile )
        or die "Cannot gunzip $gzipFile: $GunzipError\n" ;

    bzip2 $gunzip => $bzipFile
        or die "Cannot bzip2 to $bzipFile: $Bzip2Error\n" ;

Note, there is a limitation of this technique. Some compression file
formats store extra information along with the compressed data payload. For
example, gzip can optionally store the original filename and Zip stores a
lot of information about the original file. If the original compressed file
contains any of this extra information, it will not be transferred to the
new compressed file using the technique above.

=head1 ZIP

=head2 What Compression Types do IO::Compress::Zip & IO::Uncompress::Unzip support?

The following compression formats are supported by C<IO::Compress::Zip> and
C<IO::Uncompress::Unzip>

=over 5

=item * Store (method 0)

No compression at all.

=item * Deflate (method 8)

This is the default compression used when creating a zip file with
C<IO::Compress::Zip>.

=item * Bzip2 (method 12)

Only supported if the C<IO-Compress-Bzip2> module is installed.

=item * Lzma (method 14)

Only supported if the C<IO-Compress-Lzma> module is installed.

=back

=head2 Can I Read/Write Zip files larger the 4 Gig?

Yes, both the C<IO-Compress-Zip> and C<IO-Uncompress-Unzip>  modules
support the zip feature called I<Zip64>. That allows them to read/write
files/buffers larger than 4Gig.

If you are creating a Zip file using the one-shot interface, and any of the
input files is greater than 4Gig, a zip64 complaint zip file will be
created.

    zip "really-large-file" => "my.zip";

Similarly with the one-shot interface, if the input is a buffer larger than
4 Gig, a zip64 complaint zip file will be created.

    zip \$really_large_buffer => "my.zip";

The one-shot interface allows you to force the creation of a zip64 zip file
by including the C<Zip64> option.

    zip $filehandle => "my.zip", Zip64 => 1;

If you want to create a zip64 zip file with the OO interface you must
specify the C<Zip64> option.

    my $zip = IO::Compress::Zip->new( "whatever", Zip64 => 1 );

When uncompressing with C<IO-Uncompress-Unzip>, it will automatically
detect if the zip file is zip64.

If you intend to manipulate the Zip64 zip files created with
C<IO-Compress-Zip> using an external zip/unzip, make sure that it supports
Zip64.

In particular, if you are using Info-Zip you need to have zip version 3.x
or better to update a Zip64 archive and unzip version 6.x to read a zip64
archive.

=head2 Can I write more that 64K entries is a Zip files?

Yes. Zip64 allows this. See previous question.

=head2 Zip Resources

The primary reference for zip files is the "appnote" document available at
L<http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT>

An alternatively is the Info-Zip appnote. This is available from
L<ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/doc/>

=head1 GZIP

=head2 Gzip Resources

The primary reference for gzip files is RFC 1952
L<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952>

The primary site for gzip is L<http://www.gzip.org>.

=head2 Dealing with concatenated gzip files

If the gunzip program encounters a file containing multiple gzip files
concatenated together it will automatically uncompress them all.
The example below illustrates this behaviour

    $ echo abc | gzip -c >x.gz
    $ echo def | gzip -c >>x.gz
    $ gunzip -c x.gz
    abc
    def

By default C<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> will I<not> behave like the gunzip
program. It will only uncompress the first gzip data stream in the file, as
shown below

    $ perl -MIO::Uncompress::Gunzip=:all -e 'gunzip "x.gz" => \*STDOUT'
    abc

To force C<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> to uncompress all the gzip data streams,
include the C<MultiStream> option, as shown below

    $ perl -MIO::Uncompress::Gunzip=:all -e 'gunzip "x.gz" => \*STDOUT, MultiStream => 1'
    abc
    def

=head2 Reading bgzip files with IO::Uncompress::Gunzip

A C<bgzip> file consists of a series of valid gzip-compliant data streams
concatenated together. To read a file created by C<bgzip> with
C<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> use the C<MultiStream> option as shown in the
previous section.

See the section titled "The BGZF compression format" in
L<http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf> for a definition of
C<bgzip>.

=head1 ZLIB

=head2 Zlib Resources

The primary site for the I<zlib> compression library is
L<http://www.zlib.org>.

=head1 Bzip2

=head2 Bzip2 Resources

The primary site for bzip2 is L<http://www.bzip.org>.

=head2 Dealing with Concatenated bzip2 files

If the bunzip2 program encounters a file containing multiple bzip2 files
concatenated together it will automatically uncompress them all.
The example below illustrates this behaviour

    $ echo abc | bzip2 -c >x.bz2
    $ echo def | bzip2 -c >>x.bz2
    $ bunzip2 -c x.bz2
    abc
    def

By default C<IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2> will I<not> behave like the bunzip2
program. It will only uncompress the first bunzip2 data stream in the file, as
shown below

    $ perl -MIO::Uncompress::Bunzip2=:all -e 'bunzip2 "x.bz2" => \*STDOUT'
    abc

To force C<IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2> to uncompress all the bzip2 data streams,
include the C<MultiStream> option, as shown below

    $ perl -MIO::Uncompress::Bunzip2=:all -e 'bunzip2 "x.bz2" => \*STDOUT, MultiStream => 1'
    abc
    def

=head2 Interoperating with Pbzip2

Pbzip2 (L<http://compression.ca/pbzip2/>) is a parallel implementation of
bzip2. The output from pbzip2 consists of a series of concatenated bzip2
data streams.

By default C<IO::Uncompress::Bzip2> will only uncompress the first bzip2
data stream in a pbzip2 file. To uncompress the complete pbzip2 file you
must include the C<MultiStream> option, like this.

    bunzip2 $input => \$output, MultiStream => 1
        or die "bunzip2 failed: $Bunzip2Error\n";

=head1 HTTP & NETWORK

=head2 Apache::GZip Revisited

     $self->{r}->print($data);

     # print the CRC and the total length (uncompressed)
     $self->{r}->print(pack("LL",@{$self}{qw/crc l/}));

Here's the Apache configuration entry you'll need to make use of it.  Once
set it will result in everything in the /compressed directory will be
compressed automagically.

  <Location /compressed>
     SetHandler  perl-script
     PerlHandler Apache::GZip
  </Location>

Although at first sight there seems to be quite a lot going on in
C<Apache::GZip>, you could sum up what the code was doing as follows --
read the contents of the file in C<< $r->filename >>, compress it and write
the compressed data to standard output. That's all.

This code has to jump through a few hoops to achieve this because

=over

=item 1.

The gzip support in C<Compress::Zlib> version 1.x can only work with a real
filesystem filehandle. The filehandles used by Apache modules are not
associated with the filesystem.

=item 2.

That means all the gzip support has to be done by hand - in this case by
creating a tied filehandle to deal with creating the gzip header and
trailer.

=back

C<IO::Compress::Gzip> doesn't have that filehandle limitation (this was one
of the reasons for writing it in the first place). So if
C<IO::Compress::Gzip> is used instead of C<Compress::Zlib> the whole tied
filehandle code can be removed. Here is the rewritten code.

  package Apache::GZip;

  use strict vars;
  use Apache::Constants ':common';
  use IO::Compress::Gzip;
  use IO::File;

  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
      my ($fh,$gz);
      my $file = $r->filename;
      return DECLINED unless $fh=IO::File->new($file);
      $r->header_out('Content-Encoding'=>'gzip');
      $r->send_http_header;
      return OK if $r->header_only;

      my $gz = IO::Compress::Gzip->new( '-', Minimal => 1 )
          or return DECLINED ;

      print $gz $_ while <$fh>;

      return OK;
  }

or even more succinctly, like this, using a one-shot gzip

  package Apache::GZip;

  use strict vars;
  use Apache::Constants ':common';
  use IO::Compress::Gzip qw(gzip);

  sub handler {
      my $r = shift;
      $r->header_out('Content-Encoding'=>'gzip');
      $r->send_http_header;
      return OK if $r->header_only;

      gzip $r->filename => '-', Minimal => 1
        or return DECLINED ;

      return OK;
  }

  1;

The use of one-shot C<gzip> above just reads from C<< $r->filename >> and
writes the compressed data to standard output.

Note the use of the C<Minimal> option in the code above. When using gzip
for Content-Encoding you should I<always> use this option. In the example
above it will prevent the filename being included in the gzip header and
make the size of the gzip data stream a slight bit smaller.

=head2 Compressed files and Net::FTP

The C<Net::FTP> module provides two low-level methods called C<stor> and
C<retr> that both return filehandles. These filehandles can used with the
C<IO::Compress/Uncompress> modules to compress or uncompress files read
from or written to an FTP Server on the fly, without having to create a
temporary file.

Firstly, here is code that uses C<retr> to uncompressed a file as it is
read from the FTP Server.

    use Net::FTP;
    use IO::Uncompress::Gunzip qw(:all);

    my $ftp = Net::FTP->new( ... )

    my $retr_fh = $ftp->retr($compressed_filename);
    gunzip $retr_fh => $outFilename, AutoClose => 1
        or die "Cannot uncompress '$compressed_file': $GunzipError\n";

and this to compress a file as it is written to the FTP Server

    use Net::FTP;
    use IO::Compress::Gzip qw(:all);

    my $stor_fh = $ftp->stor($filename);
    gzip "filename" => $stor_fh, AutoClose => 1
        or die "Cannot compress '$filename': $GzipError\n";

=head1 MISC

=head2 Using C<InputLength> to uncompress data embedded in a larger file/buffer.

A fairly common use-case is where compressed data is embedded in a larger
file/buffer and you want to read both.

As an example consider the structure of a zip file. This is a well-defined
file format that mixes both compressed and uncompressed sections of data in
a single file.

For the purposes of this discussion you can think of a zip file as sequence
of compressed data streams, each of which is prefixed by an uncompressed
local header. The local header contains information about the compressed
data stream, including the name of the compressed file and, in particular,
the length of the compressed data stream.

To illustrate how to use C<InputLength> here is a script that walks a zip
file and prints out how many lines are in each compressed file (if you
intend write code to walking through a zip file for real see
L<IO::Uncompress::Unzip/"Walking through a zip file"> ). Also, although
this example uses the zlib-based compression, the technique can be used by
the other C<IO::Uncompress::*> modules.

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use IO::File;
    use IO::Uncompress::RawInflate qw(:all);

    use constant ZIP_LOCAL_HDR_SIG  => 0x04034b50;
    use constant ZIP_LOCAL_HDR_LENGTH => 30;

    my $file = $ARGV[0] ;

    my $fh = IO::File->new( "<$file" )
                or die "Cannot open '$file': $!\n";

    while (1)
    {
        my $sig;
        my $buffer;

        my $x ;
        ($x = $fh->read($buffer, ZIP_LOCAL_HDR_LENGTH)) == ZIP_LOCAL_HDR_LENGTH
            or die "Truncated file: $!\n";

        my $signature = unpack ("V", substr($buffer, 0, 4));

        last unless $signature == ZIP_LOCAL_HDR_SIG;

        # Read Local Header
        my $gpFlag             = unpack ("v", substr($buffer, 6, 2));
        my $compressedMethod   = unpack ("v", substr($buffer, 8, 2));
        my $compressedLength   = unpack ("V", substr($buffer, 18, 4));
        my $uncompressedLength = unpack ("V", substr($buffer, 22, 4));
        my $filename_length    = unpack ("v", substr($buffer, 26, 2));
        my $extra_length       = unpack ("v", substr($buffer, 28, 2));

        my $filename ;
        $fh->read($filename, $filename_length) == $filename_length
            or die "Truncated file\n";

        $fh->read($buffer, $extra_length) == $extra_length
            or die "Truncated file\n";

        if ($compressedMethod != 8 && $compressedMethod != 0)
        {
            warn "Skipping file '$filename' - not deflated $compressedMethod\n";
            $fh->read($buffer, $compressedLength) == $compressedLength
                or die "Truncated file\n";
            next;
        }

        if ($compressedMethod == 0 && $gpFlag & 8 == 8)
