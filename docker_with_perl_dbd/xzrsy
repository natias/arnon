 LEGAL ISSUES
 ============
 .
 In plain English:
 .
 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
    you've used the IJG code.
 .
 In legalese:
 .
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
 .
 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 .
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 .
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 .
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 .
 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
 .
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
 code.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

 Terms and Conditions for Use, Reproduction, and Distribution
 .
 The legally binding and authoritative terms and conditions for use,
 reproduction, and distribution of ImageMagick follow:
 .
 Copyright 1999-2012 ImageMagick Studio LLC, a non-profit organization
 dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.
 .
 1. Definitions.
 .
 License shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
 distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 .
 Licensor shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the
 copyright owner that is granting the License.
 .
 Legal Entity shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
 entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
 with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, control means (i)
 the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
 entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
 (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of
 such entity.
 .
 You (or Your) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
 granted by this License.
 .
 Source form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
 but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files.
 .
 Object form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
 translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
 generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
 .
 Work shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
 made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
 included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
 below).
 .
 Derivative Works shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
 modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
 authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall
 not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind
 by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 .
 Contribution shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
 version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
 Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor
 for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual
 or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright
 owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form
 of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor
 or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
 electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
 tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor
 for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
 communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
 writing by the copyright owner as Not a Contribution.
 .
 Contributor shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
 behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 .
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
 display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
 such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
 license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
 otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
 patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
 infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
 Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
 submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
 direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
 the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
 or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
 the following conditions:
 .
  * You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
    a copy of this License; and You must cause any modified files to
    carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  * You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
    You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  * If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
    the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as
    part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
