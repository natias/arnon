Cripples CTRL-V selection. (Taro Muraoka)
Allow moving to halfway an unprintable character.  Don't let getvvcol() change

In ":hardcopy > %.ps" the "%" was not expanded to the current filename.

Made ":redraw" also update the Visual area.

When a not implemented command, such as ":perl", has wrong arguments the less
important error was reported, giving the user the idea the command could work.

Motif and Athena: moving Vim to the foreground didn't uniconify it.  Use
XMapRaised() instead of XRaiseWindow(). (Srikanth Sankaran)

When using ":ptag" in a window where 'scrollbind' is set the preview window
would also have 'scrollbind' set.  Also reset 'foldcolumn' and 'diff'.

Various commands that split a window took over 'scrollbind', which is hardly
ever desired.  Esp. for "q:" and ":copen".  Mostly reset 'scrollbind' when
splitting a window.

When 'shellslash' is set in the vimrc file the first entry of ":scriptnames"
would still have backslashes.  Entries in the quickfix list could also have
wrong (back)slashes.

(Yasuhiro Matsumoto).

Win32: When 'encoding' is not the current codepage the title could not be set
to non-ascii characters.

"vim -d scp://machine/file1 scp://machine/file2" did not work, there was only
one window.  Fixed the netrw plugin not to wipe out the buffer if it is
displayed in other windows.

"/$" caused "e" in last column of screen to disappear, a highlighted blank was
displayed instead.

":s/ *\ze\n//e" removed the line break and introduced arbitrary text.  Was
using the line count including what matched after the "\ze".

Using the "c" flag with ":s" changed the behavior when a line break is
replaced and "\@<=" is used.  Without "c" a following match was not found.

":%s/\vA@<=\nB@=//gce" got stuck on "A\nB" when entering "n".

VMS: add HAVE_STRFTIME in the config file. (Zoltan Arpadffy)

When a delete prompts if a delete should continue when yanking is not
possible, restore msg_silent afterwards.

":sign" did not complain about a missing argument.

When adding or deleting a sign 'hlsearch' highlighting could disappear.

Makes the tests work on more systems.

In the DOS tests don't create "/tmp" to avoid an error.

library version of fgets() to work correctly for Metrowerks 2.2. (Axel
Kielhorn)

When typing a password a "*" was shown for each byte instead of for each
character.  Added multibyte handling to displaying the stars. (Yasuhiro
Matsumoto)

different code for 5.6 and 5.8.  (Dan Sharp)

MingW and Cygwin: Don't strip the debug executable. (Dan Sharp)

An assignment to a variable with curlies that includes "==" doesn't work.
Skip over the curlies before searching for an "=". (Vince Negri)

Files:	    runtime/filetype.vim, runtime/plugin/gzip.vim

Patch 6.1.056
Problem:    Loading the Syntax menu can take quite a bit of time.

	    available syntax files are not in the Syntax menu.
Files:	    runtime/doc/gui.txt, runtime/menu.vim

Patch 6.1.057

Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.1.060
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and 'selection' is "exclusive", deleting
	    a character just before a tab changes the tab into spaces.  Undo
	    doesn't restore the tab. (Helmut Stiegler)
Solution:   Don't replace the tab by spaces when it's not needed.  Correctly
	    save the line before it's changed.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.1.061
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and 'selection' is "exclusive", a Visual

Solution:   Use a different way to exclude the character under the cursor.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.1.062
Problem:    The "man" filetype plugin doesn't work properly on Solaris 5.

	    conform to the standard method://[user@]host[:port]/path.
Solution:   Use ftp://[user@]host[[:#]port]/path, which supports both the new
	    and the previous style.  Also added a bit of dav/cadaver support.
	    (Charles Campbell)
Files:	    runtime/plugin/netrw.vim

Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.1.071

Solution:   Subtract one from the end position.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.1.072
Problem:    When a file name in a tags file starts with http:// or something

Patch 6.1.073 (extra)
Problem:    BC5: Can't easily specify a tiny, small, normal, big or huge

Solution:   Allow selecting the version with the FEATURES variable. (Ajit
	    Thakkar)
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak

Patch 6.1.074
Problem:    When 'cdpath' includes "../..", changing to a directory in which
	    we currently already are doesn't work.  ff_check_visited() adds
	    the directory both when using it as the root for searching and for
	    the actual matches. (Stephen Rasku)
Solution:   Use a separate list for the already searched directories.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.1.078
Problem:    When using 'foldmethod' "marker" and the end marker appears before
	    the start marker in the file, no fold is found. (Nazri Ramliy)
Solution:   Don't let the fold depth go negative.
Files:	    src/fold.c

Patch 6.1.079
Problem:    When using "s" in Visual block mode with 'virtualedit' set, when
	    the selected block is after the end of some lines the wrong text

Solution:   Insert the right text and extend short lines.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.1.080
Problem:    When using gcc with /usr/local already in the search path, adding
	    it again causes problems.
Solution:   Adjust configure.in to avoid adding /usr/local/include and
	    /usr/local/lib when using GCC and they are already used. (Johannes
	    Zellner)
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in

Patch 6.1.081
Problem:    ":help CTRL-\_CTRL-N" doesn't work.  (Christian J. Robinson)
Solution:   Double the backslash to avoid the special meaning of "\_".
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.1.082
Problem:    On MS-Windows the vimrc_example.vim script is sourced and then
	    mswin.vim.  This enables using select mode, but since "p" is
	    mapped it doesn't replace the selection.
Solution:   Remove the mapping of "p" from vimrc_example.vim, it's obsolete.
	    (Vlad Sandrini)
Files:	    runtime/vimrc_example.vim

Patch 6.1.083
Problem:    When $LANG is "sk" or "sk_sk", the Slovak menu file isn't found.
	    (Martin Lacko)

	    (Muraoka Taro)
Files:	    src/Make_mvc.mak

Patch 6.1.089
Problem:    On BSDI systems there is no ss_sp field in stack_t. (Robert Jan)

Solution:   Check that CTRL-F scrolls at least one line.
Files:	    src/move.c

Patch 6.1.091

Patch 6.1.092
Problem:    ":mapclear <buffer>" doesn't work. (Srikanth Adayapalam)
Solution:   Allow an argument for ":mapclear".
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h

Patch 6.1.093 (extra)
Problem:    Mac and MS-Windows GUI: when scrolling while ":s" is working the
	    results can be messed up, because the cursor is moved.
Solution:   Disallow direct scrolling when not waiting for a character.
Files:	    src/gui_mac.c, src/gui_w16.c, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c

Solution:   Convert file name arguments to Posix.  (Chris Metcalf)
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.1.095
Problem:    When using signs can free an item on the stack.
	    Overruling sign colors doesn't work. (Srikanth Sankaran)
Solution:   Don't free the item on the stack.  Use NULL instead of "none" for
	    the value of the color.
Files:	    src/gui_x11.c

Patch 6.1.096
Problem:    When erasing the right half of a double-byte character, it may

	    in ":options" window for 'autowriteall' is wrong. (Antoine J
	    Mechelynck)  Can't insert a space in an option value.
Solution:   Use ":setlocal" instead of ":set".  Change "aw" to "awa".
	    Don't map space in Insert mode.
Files:	    runtime/optwin.vim

Patch 6.1.102
Problem:    Unprintable and multibyte characters in a statusline item are not
	    truncated correctly. (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)

Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.1.103
Problem:    A function returning from a while loop, with 'verbose' set to 12
	    or higher, doesn't mention the return value.  A function with the
	    'abort' attribute may return -1 while the verbose message says
	    something else.
Solution:   Move the verbose message about returning from a function to
	    call_func(). (Servatius Brandt)
