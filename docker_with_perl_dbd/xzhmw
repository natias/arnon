Patch 6.2.332 (extra)
Problem:    Amiga: Compile error for string array. Compiling the Amiga GUI
	    doesn't work.

Patch 6.2.338 (after 6.2.331)
Problem:    When undoing "gwap" the cursor is always put at the start of the
	    paragraph.  When undoing auto-formatting the cursor may be above
	    the change.
Solution:   Try to move the cursor back to where it was or to the first line
	    that actually changed.
Files:	    src/normal.c, src/ops.c, src/undo.c

Patch 6.2.339
Problem:    Crash when using many different highlight groups and a User
	    highlight group.  (Juergen Kraemer)

	    the path.
Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.2.342 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: macros are not always used as expected.
Solution:   Define WINVER to 0x0400 instead of 0x400. (Alejandro
	    Lopez-Valencia)
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak, src/Make_cyg.mak, src/Make_mvc.mak

Patch 6.2.343
Problem:    Title doesn't work with some window managers.  X11: Setting the
	    text property for the window title is hard coded.
Solution:   Use STRING format when possible.  Use the UTF-8 function when
	    it's available and 'encoding' is utf-8. Use
	    XStringListToTextProperty().  Do the same for the icon name.
	    (David Harrison)
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.344 (extra, after 6.2.337)

	    use the raw format if 'encoding' is the same.
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win16.c, src/os_win32.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.346
Problem:    Win32 console: After using "chcp" Vim does not detect the
	    different codepage.
Solution:   Use GetConsoleCP() and when it is different from GetACP() set
	    'termencoding'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.347 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: XP theme support is missing.
Solution:   Add a manifest and refer to it from the resource file.  (Michael
	    Wookey)
Files:	    Makefile, src/gvim.exe.mnf, src/vim.rc

Patch 6.2.348
Problem:    Win32: "vim c:\dir\(test)" doesn't work, because the 'isfname'
	    default value doesn't contain parentheses.
Solution:   Temporarily add '(' and ')' to 'isfname' when expanding file name
	    arguments.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.349
Problem:    Finding a match using 'matchpairs' may cause a crash.
	    'matchpairs' is not used for 'showmatch'.
Solution:   Don't look past the NUL in 'matchpairs'.  Use 'matchpairs' for

Solution:   Handle the pointer move event for the tear-off menu window.
Files:	    src/gui_w32.c

Patch 6.2.355 (after 6.2.303)

	    current locale, the width of characters is not correct.
	    Possible failure and memory leak when using iconv, Unicode
	    digraphs and 'encoding' is not "utf-8".
Solution:   Use iconv() to discover the actual width of characters.
	    Add the "vc_fail" field to vimconv_T.
	    When converting a digraph, init the conversion type to NONE and
	    cleanup afterwards.
Files:	    src/digraph.c, src/mbyte.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.356
Problem:    When using a double-byte 'encoding' and 'selection' is
	    "exclusive", "vy" only yanks the first byte of a double-byte
	    character.  (Xiangjiang Ma)
Solution:   Correct the column in unadjust_for_sel() to position on the first
	    byte, always include the trailing byte of the selected text.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.357 (after 6.2.321)

Solution:   Change "x86" to "X86". (Serge Pirotte)
Files:	    src/gvim.exe.mnf

Patch 6.2.363
Problem:    In an empty file with 'showmode' off, "i" doesn't change the ruler
	    from "0-1" to "1".  Typing "x<BS>" does show "1", but then <Esc>
	    doesn't make it "0-1" again.  Same problem for ruler in
	    statusline.  (Andrew Pimlott)
Solution:   Remember the "empty line" flag with Insert mode and'ed to it.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.364
Problem:    HTML version of the documentation doesn't mention the encoding,
	    which is a problem for mbyte.txt.

Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.367
Problem:    Building the help tags file while installing may fail if there is
	    another Vim in $PATH.
Solution:   Specify the just installed Vim executable. (Gordon Prieur)
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.368
Problem:    When 'autochdir' is set, closing a window doesn't change to the
	    directory of the new current window. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Handle 'autochdir' always when a window becomes the current one.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.369
Problem:    Various memory leaks: when using globpath(), when searching for
	    help tags files, when defining a function inside a function, when
	    giving an error message through an exception, for the final "."
	    line in ":append", in expression "cond ? a : b" that fails and for
	    missing ")" in an expression.  Using NULL pointer when adding
	    first user command and for pointer computations with regexp.
	    (tests by Dominique Pelle)
Solution:   Fix the leaks by freeing the allocated memory.  Don't use the
	    array of user commands when there are no entries.  Use a macro
	    instead of a function call for saving and restoring regexp states.
Files:	    src/eval.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/regexp.c, src/screen.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.370 (extra, after6.2.341)
Problem:    Win32: When the path to diff.exe contains a space and using the
	    vimrc generated by the install program, diff mode may not work.
	    (Alejandro Lopez-Valencia)
Solution:   Do not use double quotes for arguments that do not have a space.
Files:	    src/dosinst.c

Patch 6.2.371
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set and there is a Tab before the next "x",
	    "dtx" does not delete the whole Tab. (Ken Hashishi)
Solution:   Move the cursor to the last position of the Tab.  Also for
	    "df<Tab>".
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.372
Problem:    When using balloon evaluation, no value is displayed for members
	    of structures and items of an array.
Solution:   Include "->", "." and "[*]" in the expression.
Files:	    src/gui_beval.c, src/normal.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.373
Problem:    When 'winminheight' is zero and a window is reduced to zero
	    height, the ruler always says "Top" instead of the cursor
	    position. (Antoine J. Mechelynck)
Solution:   Don't recompute w_topline for a zero-height window.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.374
Problem:    ":echo "hello" | silent normal n" removes the "hello" message.
	    (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Don't echo the search string when ":silent" was used.  Also don't
	    show the mode.  In general: don't clear to the end of the screen.
Files:	    src/gui.c, src/message.c, src/os_unix.c, src/proto/message.pro,
	    src/screen.c, src/search.c, src/window.c

Patch 6.2.375
Problem:    When changing 'guioptions' the hit-enter prompt may be below the
	    end of the Vim window.
Solution:   Call screen_alloc() before showing the prompt.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.376
Problem:    Win32: Ruby interface cannot be dynamically linked with Ruby 1.6.
Solution:   Add #ifdefs around use of rb_w32_snprintf().  (Benoît Cerrina)
Files:	    src/if_ruby.c

Patch 6.2.377 (after 6.2.372)
Problem:    Compiler warnings for signed/unsigned compare. (Michael Wookey)
Solution:   Add type cast.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.378 (extra, after 6.2.118)
Problem:    Mac: cannot build with Project Builder.
Solution:   Add remove_tail_with_ext() to locate and remove the "build"
	    directory from the runtime path.  Include os_unix.c when needed.
	    (Dany St Amant)
Files:	    src/misc1.c, src/os_macosx.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.379
Problem:    Using ":mkvimrc" in the ":options" window sets 'bufhidden' to
	    "delete". (Michael Naumann)
Solution:   Do not add buffer-specific option values to a global vimrc file.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.380 (extra)
Problem:    DOS: "make test" fails when running it again.  Can't "make test"
	    with Borland C.
Solution:   Make sure ".out" files are deleted when they get in the way.  Add
	    a "test" target to the Borland C Makefile.
Files:	    src/Make_bc5.mak, src/testdir/Make_dos.mak

Patch 6.2.381
Problem:    Setting 'fileencoding' to a comma-separated list (confusing it
	    with 'fileencodings') does not result in an error message.
	    Setting 'fileencoding' in an empty file marks it as modified.
	    There is no "+" in the title after setting 'fileencoding'.
Solution:   Check for a comma in 'fileencoding'.  Only consider a non-empty
	    file modified by changing 'fileencoding'.  Update the title after
	    changing 'fileencoding'.
Files:	    src/option.c

Patch 6.2.382
Problem:    Running "make test" puts marks from test files in viminfo.
Solution:   Specify a different viminfo file to use.
Files:	    src/testdir/test15.in, src/testdir/test49.in

Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.385  (extra)
Problem:    Win32: forward_slash() and trash_input_buf() are undefined when
	    compiling with small features. (Ajit Thakkar)
Solution:   Change the #ifdefs for forward_slash().  Don't call
	    trash_input_buf() if the input buffer isn't used.
Files:	    src/fileio.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.386
Problem:    Wasting time trying to read marks from the viminfo file for a
	    buffer without a name.
Solution:   Skip reading marks when the buffer has no name.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.387
Problem:    There is no highlighting of translated items in help files.
Solution:   Search for a "help_ab.vim" syntax file when the help file is
	    called "*.abx".  Also improve the help highlighting a bit.
Files:	    runtime/syntax/help.vim

Patch 6.2.388
Problem:    GTK: When displaying some double-width characters they are drawn
	    as single-width, because of conversion to UTF-8.
Solution:   Check the width that GTK uses and add a space if it's one instead
	    of two.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.389
Problem:    When working over a slow connection, it's very annoying that the
	    last line is partly drawn and then cleared for every change.
Solution:   Don't redraw the bottom line if no rows were inserted or deleted.
	    Don't draw the line if we know "@" lines will be used.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.390
Problem:    Using "r*" in Visual mode on multibyte characters only replaces
	    every other character. (Tyson Roberts)
Solution:   Correct the cursor position after replacing each character.
Files:	    src/ops.c

Patch 6.2.391 (extra)
Problem:    The ":highlight" command is not tested.
Solution:   Add a test script for ":highlight".

	    src/testdir/test51.ok

Patch 6.2.392 (after 6.2.384)
Problem:    Unused variable.
Solution:   Remove "dlen".
Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 6.2.393
Problem:    When using very long lines the viminfo file can become very big.
Solution:   Add the "s" flag to 'viminfo': skip registers with more than the
	    specified Kbyte of text.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/ops.c, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.394  (after 6.2.391)
Problem:    Test 51 fails on a terminal with 8 colors. (Tony Leneis)
Solution:   Use "DarkBlue" instead of "Blue" to avoid the "bold" attribute.
Files:	    src/testdir/test51.in

Patch 6.2.395
Problem:    When using ":tag" or ":pop" the previous matching tag is used.
	    But since the current file is different, the ordering of the tags
	    may change.
Solution:   Remember what the current buffer was for when re-using cur_match.
Files:	    src/edit.c, src/ex_cmds.c, src/proto/tag.pro, src/structs.h,
	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.396
Problem:    When CTRL-T jumps to another file and an autocommand moves the
	    cursor to the '" mark, don't end up on the right line.  (Michal
	    Malecki)
Solution:   Set the line number after loading the file.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.397
Problem:    When using a double-byte 'encoding' mapping <M-x> doesn't work.
	    (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Solution:   Do not set the 8th bit of the character but use a modifier.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/gui_x11.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.398 (extra)
Problem:    Win32 console: no extra key modifiers are supported.
Solution:   Encode the modifiers into the input stream.  Also fix that special
	    keys are converted and stop working when 'tenc' is set.  Also fix
	    that when 'tenc' is initialized the input and output conversion is
	    not setup properly until 'enc' or 'tenc' is set.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/option.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.399
Problem:    A ":set" command that fails still writes a message when it is

Patch 6.2.401
Problem:    When opening a buffer that was previously opened, Vim does not
	    restore the cursor position if the first line starts with white
	    space.  (Gregory Margo)
Solution:   Don't skip restoring the cursor position if it is past the blanks
	    in the first line.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 6.2.402
Problem:    Mac: "make install" doesn't generate help tags. (Benji Fisher)
Solution:   Generate help tags before copying the runtime files.
Files:	    src/Makefile

Patch 6.2.403
Problem:    ":@y" checks stdin if there are more commands to execute.  This
	    fails if stdin is not connected, e.g., when starting the GUI from
	    KDE. (Ned Konz)
Solution:   Only check for a next command if there still is typeahead.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.404
Problem:    Our own function to determine width of Unicode characters may get
	    outdated. (Markus Kuhn)

Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c

Patch 6.2.407 (after 6.2.299)
Problem:    ":help \@<=" doesn't find help.
Solution:   Avoid that ":help \@<=" searches for the "<=" language.
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.408
Problem:    ":compiler" is not consistent: Sets local options and a global
	    variable. (Douglas Potts)  There is no error message when a
	    compiler is not supported.
Solution:   Use ":compiler!" to set a compiler globally, otherwise it's local
	    to the buffer and "b:current_compiler" is used.  Give an error
	    when no compiler script could be found.
	    Note: updated compiler plugins can be found at
	    ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/compiler/
Files:	    runtime/compiler/msvc.vim, runtime/doc/quickfix.txt, src/eval.c,

	    (Toby Allsopp)
Solution:   Adjust the cursor as if in Insert mode.
Files:	    src/misc1.c

Patch 6.2.410 (after 6.2.389)
Problem:    In diff mode, when there are more filler lines than fit in the
	    window, they are not drawn.
Solution:   Check for filler lines when skipping to draw a line that doesn't
	    fit.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.411
Problem:    A "\n" inside a string is not seen as a line break by the regular
	    expression matching. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Add the vim_regexec_nl() function for strings where "\n" is to be
	    matched with a line break.

Patch 6.2.412
Problem:    Ruby: "ruby << EOF" inside a function doesn't always work.  Also
	    for ":python", ":tcl" and ":perl".
Solution:   Check for "<< marker" and skip until "marker" before checking for
	    "endfunction".
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.413 (after 6.2.411)
Problem:    Missing prototype for vim_regexec_nl(). (Marcel Svitalsky)
Solution:   Now really include the prototype.
Files:	    src/proto/regexp.pro

Patch 6.2.414
Problem:    The function used for custom completion of user commands cannot
	    have <SID> to make it local. (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Pass the SID of the script where the user command was defined on
	    to the completion.  Also clean up #ifdefs.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/eval.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/structs.h

Patch 6.2.415
Problem:    Vim may crash after a sequence of events that change the window
	    size.  The window layout assumes a larger window than is actually
	    available. (Servatius Brandt)
Solution:   Invoke win_new_shellsize() from screenalloc() instead of from
	    set_shellsize().
Files:	    src/screen.c, src/term.c

Patch 6.2.416
Problem:    Compiler warning for incompatible pointer.
Solution:   Remove the "&" in the call to poll(). (Xavier de Gaye)
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.417 (after 6.2.393)
Problem:    Many people forget that the '"' item in 'viminfo' needs to be
	    preceded with a backslash,
Solution:   Add '<' as an alias for the '"' item.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/ops.c, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.418
Problem:    Using ":nnoremap <F12> :echo "cheese" and ":cabbr cheese xxx":
	    when pressing <F12> still uses the abbreviation. (Hari Krishna)
Solution:   Also apply "noremap" to abbreviations.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.419 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Cannot open the Vim window inside another application.
Solution:   Add the "-P" argument to specify the window title of the
	    application to run inside. (Zibo Zhao)

	    src/gui_w48.c, src/if_ole.cpp, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/proto/gui_w32.pro

Patch 6.2.420
Problem:    Cannot specify a file to be edited in binary mode without setting
	    the global value of the 'binary' option.
Solution:   Support ":edit ++bin file".
Files:	    runtime/doc/editing.txt, src/buffer.c, src/eval.c, src/ex_cmds.h,
	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/fileio.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.421
Problem:    Cannot set the '[ and '] mark, which may be necessary when an
	    autocommand simulates reading a file.
Solution:   Allow using "m[" and "m]".
Files:	    runtime/doc/motion.txt, src/mark.c

Patch 6.2.422
Problem:    In CTRL-X completion messages the "/" makes them less readable.
Solution:   Remove the slashes. (Antony Scriven)
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.423
Problem:    ":vertical wincmd ]" does not split vertically.
Solution:   Add "postponed_split_flags".
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/globals.h, src/if_cscope.c, src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.424
Problem:    A BufEnter autocommand that sets an option stops 'mousefocus' from
	    working in Insert mode (Normal mode is OK). (Gregory Seidman)
Solution:   In the Insert mode loop invoke gui_mouse_correct() when needed.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.425
Problem:    Vertical split and command line window: can only drag status line
	    above the cmdline window on the righthand side, not lefthand side.
Solution:   Check the status line row instead of the window pointer.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.426
Problem:    A syntax region end match with a matchgroup that includes a line
	    break only highlights the last line with matchgroup. (Gary
	    Holloway)
Solution:   Also use the line number of the position where the region
	    highlighting ends.
Files:	    src/syntax.c

Patch 6.2.427 (extra)
Problem:    When pasting a lot of text in a multibyte encoding, conversion
	    from 'termencoding' to 'encoding' may fail for some characters.
	    (Kuang-che Wu)
Solution:   When there is an incomplete byte sequence at the end of the read
	    text keep it for the next time.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c, src/os_amiga.c, src/os_mswin.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro,
	    src/proto/os_mswin.pro, src/ui.c

Patch 6.2.428
Problem:    The X11 clipboard supports the Vim selection for char/line/block
	    mode, but since the encoding is not included  can't copy/paste
	    between two Vims with a different 'encoding'.
Solution:   Add a new selection format that includes the 'encoding'.  Perform
	    conversion when necessary.
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c, src/ui.c, src/vim.h

Patch 6.2.429
Problem:    Unix: glob() doesn't work for a directory with a single quote in
	    the name. (Nazri Ramliy)
Solution:   When using the shell to expand, only put double quotes around
	    spaces and single quotes, not the whole thing.
Files:	    src/os_unix.c

Patch 6.2.430
Problem:    BOM at start of a vim script file is not recognized and causes an
	    error message.
Solution:   Detect the BOM and skip over it.  Also fix that after using
	    ":scriptencoding" the iconv() file descriptor was not closed
	    (memory leak).
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

Patch 6.2.431
Problem:    When using the horizontal scrollbar, the scrolling is limited to
	    the length of the cursor line.
Solution:   Make the scroll limit depend on the longest visible line.  The
	    cursor is moved when necessary.  Including the 'h' flag in
	    'guioptions' disables this.
Files:	    runtime/doc/gui.txt, runtime/doc/options.txt, src/gui.c,
	    src/misc2.c, src/option.h

Patch 6.2.432 (after 6.2.430 and 6.2.431)

Solution:   Add type casts.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c, src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.433
Problem:    Translating "VISUAL" and "BLOCK" separately doesn't give a good
	    result. (Alejandro Lopez Valencia)
Solution:   Use a string for each combination.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.434 (after 6.2.431)
Problem:    Compiler warning. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Add type casts.
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.435
Problem:    When there are vertically split windows the minimal Vim window
	    height is computed wrong.
Solution:   Use frame_minheight() to correctly compute the minimal height.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 6.2.436
Problem:    Running the tests changes the user's viminfo file.
Solution:   In test 49 tell the extra Vim to use the test viminfo file.
Files:	    src/testdir/test49.vim

Patch 6.2.437
Problem:    ":mksession" always puts "set nocompatible" in the session file.
	    This changes option settings. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Add an "if" to only change 'compatible' when needed.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.438
Problem:    When the 'v' flag is present in 'cpoptions', backspacing and then
	    typing text again: one character too much is overtyped before
	    inserting is done again.
Solution:   Set "dollar_vcol" to the right column.
Files:	    src/edit.c

Patch 6.2.439
Problem:    GTK 2: Changing 'lines' may cause a mismatch between the window
	    layout and the size of the window.
Solution:   Disable the hack with force_shell_resize_idle().
Files:	    src/gui_gtk_x11.c

Patch 6.2.440
Problem:    When 'lazyredraw' is set the window title is still updated.
	    The size of the Visual area and the ruler are displayed too often.
Solution:   Postpone redrawing the window title.  Only show the Visual area
	    size when waiting for a character.  Don't draw the ruler
	    unnecessary.
Files:	    src/buffer.c, src/normal.c, src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.441
Problem:    ":unabbreviate foo " doesn't work, because of the trailing space,
	    while an abbreviation with a trailing space is not possible. (Paul
	    Jolly)
Solution:   Accept a match with the lhs of an abbreviation without the
	    trailing space.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 6.2.442
Problem:    Cannot manipulate the command line from a function.
Solution:   Add getcmdline(), getcmdpos() and setcmdpos() functions and the
	    CTRL-\ e command.
Files:	    runtime/doc/cmdline.txt, runtime/doc/eval.txt, src/eval.c
	    src/ex_getln.c, src/ops.c, src/proto/ex_getln.pro,
	    src/proto/ops.pro

Patch 6.2.443
Problem:    With ":silent! echoerr something" you don't get the position of
	    the error.  emsg() only writes the message itself and returns.
Solution:   Also redirect the position of the error.
Files:	    src/message.c

Patch 6.2.444
Problem:    When adding the 'c' flag to a ":substitute" command it may replace
	    more times than without the 'c' flag.  Happens for a  match that
	    starts with "\ze" (Marcel Svitalsky) and when using "\@<=" (Klaus
	    Bosau).
Solution:   Correct "prev_matchcol" when replacing the line.  Don't replace
	    the line when the pattern uses look-behind matching.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/proto/regexp.pro, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.445
Problem:    Copying vimtutor to /tmp/something is not secure, a symlink may
	    cause trouble.
Solution:   Create a directory and create the file in it.  Use "umask" to
	    create the directory with mode 700.  (Stefan Nordhausen)
Files:	    src/vimtutor

Patch 6.2.446 (after 6.2.404)
Problem:    Using library functions wcwidth() and iswprint() results in
	    display problems for Hebrew characters. (Ron Aaron)
Solution:   Disable the code to use the library functions, use our own.
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.447 (after 6.2.440)
Problem:    Now that the title is only updated when redrawing, it is no longer
	    possible to show it while executing a function. (Madoka Machitani)
Solution:   Make ":redraw" also update the title.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 6.2.448 (after 6.2.427)
Problem:    Mac: conversion done when 'termencoding' differs from 'encoding'
	    fails when pasting a longer text.
Solution:   Check for an incomplete sequence at the end of the chunk to be
	    converted. (Eckehard Berns)
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.449 (after 6.2.431)

	    horizontal scrollbar. (Helmut Stiegler)
Files:	    src/gui.c

Patch 6.2.450
Problem:    "  #include" and "  #define" are not recognized with the default
	    option values for 'include' and 'defined'. (RG Kiran)
Solution:   Adjust the default values to allow white space before the #.
Files:	    runtime/doc/options.txt, src/option.c

Patch 6.2.451
Problem:    GTK: when using XIM there are various problems, including setting
	    'modified' and breaking undo at the wrong moment.
Solution:   Add "xim_changed_while_preediting", "preedit_end_col" and
	    im_is_preediting(). (Yasuhiro Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/ex_getln.c, src/globals.h, src/gui_gtk.c, src/gui_gtk_x11.c,
	    src/mbyte.c, src/misc1.c, src/proto/mbyte.pro, src/screen.c,
	    src/undo.c

Patch 6.2.452
Problem:    In diff mode, when DiffAdd and DiffText highlight settings are
	    equal, an added line is highlighted with DiffChange. (Tom Schumm)
Solution:   Remember the diff highlight type instead of the attributes.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 6.2.453
Problem:    ":s/foo\|\nbar/x/g" does not replace two times in "foo\nbar".
	    (Pavel Papushev)
Solution:   When the pattern can match a line break also try matching at the
	    NUL at the end of a line.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.454
Problem:    ":let b:changedtick" doesn't work. (Alan Schmitt)  ":let
	    b:changedtick = 99" does not give an error message.
Solution:   Add code to recognize ":let b:changedtick".
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.455 (after 6.2.297)
Problem:    In Python commands the current locale changes how certain Python
	    functions work. (Eugene M. Minkovskii)

Files:	    src/if_python.c

Patch 6.2.456 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: Editing a file by its Unicode name (dropping it on Vim or
	    using the file selection dialog) doesn't work. (Yakov Lerner, Alex
	    Jakushev)
Solution:   Use wide character functions when file names are involved and
	    convert from/to 'encoding' where needed.
Files:	    src/gui_w48.c, src/macros.h, src/memfile.c, src/memline.c,
	    src/os_mswin.c, src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.457 (after 6.2.244)
Problem:    When 'encoding' is "utf-8" and writing text with chars above 0x80
	    in latin1, conversion is wrong every 8200 bytes. (Oyvind Holm)
Solution:   Correct the utf_ptr2len_check_len() function and fix the problem
	    of displaying 0xf7 in utfc_ptr2len_check_len().
Files:	    src/mbyte.c

Patch 6.2.458
Problem:    When 'virtualedit' is set "$" doesn't move to the end of an
	    unprintable character, causing "y$" not to include that character.
	    (Fred Ma)
Solution:   Set "coladd" to move the cursor to the end of the character.
Files:	    src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.459 (after 6.2.454)
Problem:    Variable "b" cannot be written. (Salman Halim)
Solution:   Compare strings properly.

Problem:    After using a search command "x" starts putting single characters
	    in the numbered registers.
Solution:   Reset "use_reg_one" at the right moment.
Files:	    src/normal.c

Patch 6.2.462
Problem:    Finding a matching parenthesis does not correctly handle a
	    backslash in a trailing byte.
Solution:   Handle multibyte characters correctly. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/search.c

Patch 6.2.463 (extra)
Problem:    Win32: An NTFS file system may contain files with extra info
	    streams.  The current method to copy them creates one and then
	    deletes it again.  (Peter Toennies)  Also, only three streams with
	    hard coded names are copied.
Solution:   Use BackupRead() to check which info streams the original file
	    contains and only copy these streams.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.464 (extra, after 6.2.427)
Problem:    Amiga: Compilation error with gcc. (Ali Akcaagac)
Solution:   Move the #ifdef outside of Read().
Files:	    src/os_amiga.c

Patch 6.2.465
Problem:    When resizing the GUI window the window manager sometimes moves it
	    left of or above the screen. (Michael McCarty)

	    Matsumoto)
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.467 (extra, after 6.2.463)
Problem:    Win32: can't compile without multibyte feature. (Ajit Thakkar)
Solution:   Add #ifdefs around the info stream code.
Files:	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.468
Problem:    Compiler warnings for shadowed variables. (Matthias Mohr)
Solution:   Delete superfluous variables and rename others.

	    src/regexp.c

Patch 6.2.469 (extra, after 6.2.456)
Problem:    Win32: Can't create swap file when 'encoding' differs from the
	    active code page. (Kriton Kyrimis)
Solution:   In enc_to_ucs2() terminate the converted string with a NUL
Files:	    src/os_mswin.c

Patch 6.2.470
Problem:    The name returned by tempname() may be equal to the file used for
	    shell output when ignoring case.
Solution:   Skip 'O' and 'I' in tempname().
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 6.2.471
Problem:    "-L/usr/lib" is used in the link command, even though it's
	    supposed to be filtered out. "-lw" and "-ldl" are not
	    automatically added when needed for "-lXmu". (Antonio Colombo)
Solution:   Check for a space after the argument instead of before.  Also
	    remove "-R/usr/lib" if it's there.  Check for "-lw" and "-ldl"
	    before trying "-lXmu".
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/link.sh

Patch 6.2.472
Problem:    When using a FileChangedShell autocommand that changes the current
	    buffer, a buffer exists that can't be wiped out.
	    Also, Vim sometimes crashes when executing an external command
	    that changes the buffer and a FileChangedShell autocommand is
	    used.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
	    Users are confused by the warning for a file being changed outside
	    of Vim.
Solution:   Avoid that the window counter for a buffer is incremented twice.
	    Avoid that buf_check_timestamp() is used recursively.
	    Add a hint to look in the help for more info.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.c, src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.473
Problem:    Using CTRL-] in a help buffer without a name causes a crash.
Solution:   Check for name to be present before using it. (Taro Muraoka)
Files:	    src/tag.c

Patch 6.2.474 (extra, after 6.2.456)
Problem:    When Vim is starting up conversion is done unnecessarily.  Failure
	    to find the runtime files on Windows 98. (Randall W. Morris)
Solution:   Init enc_codepage negative, only use it when not negative.
	    Don't use GetFileAttributesW() on Windows 98 or earlier.
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/gui_w32.c, src/gui_w48.c, src/os_mswin.c,
	    src/os_win32.c

Patch 6.2.475
Problem:    Commands after "perl <<EOF" are parsed as Vim commands when they
	    are not executed.
Solution:   Properly skip over the perl commands.
Files:	    src/ex_docmd.c, src/ex_getln.c, src/if_perl.xs, src/if_python.c,
	    src/if_ruby.c, src/if_tcl.c, src/misc2.c

Patch 6.2.476
Problem:    When reloading a hidden buffer changed outside of Vim and the
	    current buffer is read-only, the reloaded buffer becomes
	    read-only.  (Hari Krishna Dara)
Solution:   Save the 'readonly' flag of the reloaded buffer instead of the
	    current buffer.
Files:	    src/fileio.c

Patch 6.2.477
Problem:    Using remote_send(v:servername, "\<C-V>") causes Vim to hang.
	    (Yakov Lerner)
Solution:   When the resulting string is empty don't set received_from_client.
Files:	    src/main.c

Patch 6.2.478
Problem:    Win32: "--remote file" fails changing directory if the current
	    directory name starts with a single quote.  (Iestyn Walters)
Solution:   Add a backslash where it will be removed later.
Files:	    src/main.c, src/misc2.c, src/proto/misc2.pro

Patch 6.2.479
Problem:    The error message for errors during recovery goes unnoticed.
Solution:   Avoid that the hit-enter prompt overwrites the message.  Add a few
	    lines to make the error stand out.
Files:	    src/main.c, src/message.c, src/memline.c

Patch 6.2.480
Problem:    NetBeans: Using negative index in array.  backslash at end of
	    message may cause Vim to crash. (Xavier de Gaye)
Solution:   Initialize buf_list_used to zero. Check for trailing backslash.
Files:	    src/netbeans.c

Patch 6.2.481
Problem:    When writing a file it is not possible to specify that hard and/or
	    symlinks are to be broken instead of preserved.
Solution:   Add the "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values to 'backupcopy'.
	    (Simon Ekstrand)
