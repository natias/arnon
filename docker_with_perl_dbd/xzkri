  $x = Math::BigFloat -> new('12_3.456_789_123_456_789E-2');

Operations with overloaded operators preserve the arguments, which is
exactly what you expect.

=head2 Input

Input values to these routines may be any scalar number or string that looks
like a number. Anything that is accepted by Perl as a literal numeric constant
should be accepted by this module.

=over

=item *

Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.

=item *

Leading zeros are ignored, except for floating point numbers with a binary
exponent, in which case the number is interpreted as an octal floating point
number. For example, "01.4p+0" gives 1.5, "00.4p+0" gives 0.5, but "0.4p+0"
gives a NaN. And while "0377" gives 255, "0377p0" gives 255.

=item *

If the string has a "0x" or "0X" prefix, it is interpreted as a hexadecimal
number.

=item *

If the string has a "0o" or "0O" prefix, it is interpreted as an octal number. A
floating point literal with a "0" prefix is also interpreted as an octal number.

=item *

If the string has a "0b" or "0B" prefix, it is interpreted as a binary number.

=item *

Underline characters are allowed in the same way as they are allowed in literal
numerical constants.

=item *

If the string can not be interpreted, NaN is returned.

=item *

For hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point numbers, the exponent must be
separated from the significand (mantissa) by the letter "p" or "P", not "e" or
"E" as with decimal numbers.

=head2 Output

Output values are usually Math::BigFloat objects.

Boolean operators C<is_zero()>, C<is_one()>, C<is_inf()>, etc. return true or
false.

Comparison operators C<bcmp()> and C<bacmp()>) return -1, 0, 1, or
undef.

=head1 METHODS

Math::BigFloat supports all methods that Math::BigInt supports, except it
calculates non-integer results when possible. Please see L<Math::BigInt> for a
full description of each method. Below are just the most important differences:

=head2 Configuration methods

=over

=item accuracy()

    $x->accuracy(5);           # local for $x
    CLASS->accuracy(5);        # global for all members of CLASS
                               # Note: This also applies to new()!

    $A = $x->accuracy();       # read out accuracy that affects $x
    $A = CLASS->accuracy();    # read out global accuracy

Set or get the global or local accuracy, aka how many significant digits the
results have. If you set a global accuracy, then this also applies to new()!

Warning! The accuracy I<sticks>, e.g. once you created a number under the
influence of C<< CLASS->accuracy($A) >>, all results from math operations with
that number will also be rounded.

In most cases, you should probably round the results explicitly using one of
L<Math::BigInt/round()>, L<Math::BigInt/bround()> or L<Math::BigInt/bfround()>
or by passing the desired accuracy to the math operation as additional
parameter:

    my $x = Math::BigInt->new(30000);
    my $y = Math::BigInt->new(7);
    print scalar $x->copy()->bdiv($y, 2);           # print 4300
    print scalar $x->copy()->bdiv($y)->bround(2);   # print 4300

=item precision()

    $x->precision(-2);        # local for $x, round at the second
                              # digit right of the dot
    $x->precision(2);         # ditto, round at the second digit
                              # left of the dot

    CLASS->precision(5);      # Global for all members of CLASS
                              # This also applies to new()!
    CLASS->precision(-5);     # ditto

    $P = CLASS->precision();  # read out global precision
    $P = $x->precision();     # read out precision that affects $x

Note: You probably want to use L</accuracy()> instead. With L</accuracy()> you
set the number of digits each result should have, with L</precision()> you
set the place where to round!

=head2 Constructor methods

=over

=item from_hex()

    $x -> from_hex("0x1.921fb54442d18p+1");
    $x = Math::BigFloat -> from_hex("0x1.921fb54442d18p+1");

Interpret input as a hexadecimal string.A prefix ("0x", "x", ignoring case) is
optional. A single underscore character ("_") may be placed between any two
digits. If the input is invalid, a NaN is returned. The exponent is in base 2
using decimal digits.

If called as an instance method, the value is assigned to the invocand.

=item from_oct()

    $x -> from_oct("1.3267p-4");
    $x = Math::BigFloat -> from_oct("1.3267p-4");

Interpret input as an octal string. A single underscore character ("_") may be
placed between any two digits. If the input is invalid, a NaN is returned. The
exponent is in base 2 using decimal digits.

If called as an instance method, the value is assigned to the invocand.

=item from_bin()

    $x -> from_bin("0b1.1001p-4");
    $x = Math::BigFloat -> from_bin("0b1.1001p-4");

Interpret input as a hexadecimal string. A prefix ("0b" or "b", ignoring case)
is optional. A single underscore character ("_") may be placed between any two
digits. If the input is invalid, a NaN is returned. The exponent is in base 2
using decimal digits.

If called as an instance method, the value is assigned to the invocand.

=item from_ieee754()

Interpret the input as a value encoded as described in IEEE754-2008.  The input
can be given as a byte string, hex string or binary string. The input is
assumed to be in big-endian byte-order.

        # both $dbl and $mbf are 3.141592...
        $bytes = "\x40\x09\x21\xfb\x54\x44\x2d\x18";
        $dbl = unpack "d>", $bytes;
        $mbf = Math::BigFloat -> from_ieee754($bytes, "binary64");

=item bpi()

    print Math::BigFloat->bpi(100), "\n";

Calculate PI to N digits (including the 3 before the dot). The result is
rounded according to the current rounding mode, which defaults to "even".

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=back

=head2 Arithmetic methods

=over

=item bmuladd()

    $x->bmuladd($y,$z);

Multiply $x by $y, and then add $z to the result.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item binv()

    $x->binv();

Invert the value of $x, i.e., compute 1/$x.

=item bdiv()

    $q = $x->bdiv($y);
    ($q, $r) = $x->bdiv($y);

In scalar context, divides $x by $y and returns the result to the given or
default accuracy/precision. In list context, does floored division
(F-division), returning an integer $q and a remainder $r so that $x = $q * $y +
$r. The remainer (modulo) is equal to what is returned by C<< $x->bmod($y) >>.

=item bmod()

    $x->bmod($y);

Returns $x modulo $y. When $x is finite, and $y is finite and non-zero, the
result is identical to the remainder after floored division (F-division). If,
in addition, both $x and $y are integers, the result is identical to the result
from Perl's % operator.

=item bexp()

    $x->bexp($accuracy);            # calculate e ** X

Calculates the expression C<e ** $x> where C<e> is Euler's number.

This method was added in v1.82 of Math::BigInt (April 2007).

=item bnok()

    $x->bnok($y);   # x over y (binomial coefficient n over k)

Calculates the binomial coefficient n over k, also called the "choose"
function. The result is equivalent to:

    ( n )      n!
    | - |  = -------
    ( k )    k!(n-k)!

This method was added in v1.84 of Math::BigInt (April 2007).

=item bsin()

    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(1);
    print $x->bsin(100), "\n";

Calculate the sinus of $x, modifying $x in place.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item bcos()

    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(1);
    print $x->bcos(100), "\n";

Calculate the cosinus of $x, modifying $x in place.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item batan()

    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(1);
    print $x->batan(100), "\n";

Calculate the arcus tanges of $x, modifying $x in place. See also L</batan2()>.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item batan2()

    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(2);
    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(3);
    print $y->batan2($x), "\n";

Calculate the arcus tanges of C<$y> divided by C<$x>, modifying $y in place.
See also L</batan()>.

This method was added in v1.87 of Math::BigInt (June 2007).

=item as_float()

This method is called when Math::BigFloat encounters an object it doesn't know
how to handle. For instance, assume $x is a Math::BigFloat, or subclass
thereof, and $y is defined, but not a Math::BigFloat, or subclass thereof. If
you do

    $x -> badd($y);

$y needs to be converted into an object that $x can deal with. This is done by
first checking if $y is something that $x might be upgraded to. If that is the
case, no further attempts are made. The next is to see if $y supports the
method C<as_float()>. The method C<as_float()> is expected to return either an
object that has the same class as $x, a subclass thereof, or a string that
C<ref($x)-E<gt>new()> can parse to create an object.

In Math::BigFloat, C<as_float()> has the same effect as C<copy()>.

=item to_ieee754()

Encodes the invocand as a byte string in the given format as specified in IEEE
754-2008. Note that the encoded value is the nearest possible representation of
the value. This value might not be exactly the same as the value in the
invocand.

    # $x = 3.1415926535897932385
    $x = Math::BigFloat -> bpi(30);

    $b = $x -> to_ieee754("binary64");  # encode as 8 bytes
    $h = unpack "H*", $b;               # "400921fb54442d18"

    # 3.141592653589793115997963...
    $y = Math::BigFloat -> from_ieee754($h, "binary64");

All binary formats in IEEE 754-2008 are accepted. For convenience, som aliases
are recognized: "half" for "binary16", "single" for "binary32", "double" for
"binary64", "quadruple" for "binary128", "octuple" for "binary256", and
"sexdecuple" for "binary512".

=back

=head2 ACCURACY AND PRECISION

See also: L<Rounding|/Rounding>.

Math::BigFloat supports both precision (rounding to a certain place before or
after the dot) and accuracy (rounding to a certain number of digits). For a
full documentation, examples and tips on these topics please see the large
section about rounding in L<Math::BigInt>.

Since things like C<sqrt(2)> or C<1 / 3> must presented with a limited
accuracy lest a operation consumes all resources, each operation produces
no more than the requested number of digits.

If there is no global precision or accuracy set, B<and> the operation in
question was not called with a requested precision or accuracy, B<and> the
input $x has no accuracy or precision set, then a fallback parameter will
be used. For historical reasons, it is called C<div_scale> and can be accessed
via:

    $d = Math::BigFloat->div_scale();       # query
    Math::BigFloat->div_scale($n);          # set to $n digits

The default value for C<div_scale> is 40.

In case the result of one operation has more digits than specified,
it is rounded. The rounding mode taken is either the default mode, or the one
supplied to the operation after the I<scale>:

    $x = Math::BigFloat->new(2);
    Math::BigFloat->accuracy(5);              # 5 digits max
    $y = $x->copy()->bdiv(3);                 # gives 0.66667
    $y = $x->copy()->bdiv(3,6);               # gives 0.666667
    $y = $x->copy()->bdiv(3,6,undef,'odd');   # gives 0.666667
    Math::BigFloat->round_mode('zero');
    $y = $x->copy()->bdiv(3,6);               # will also give 0.666667

Note that C<< Math::BigFloat->accuracy() >> and
C<< Math::BigFloat->precision() >> set the global variables, and thus B<any>
newly created number will be subject to the global rounding B<immediately>. This
means that in the examples above, the C<3> as argument to C<bdiv()> will also
get an accuracy of B<5>.

It is less confusing to either calculate the result fully, and afterwards
round it explicitly, or use the additional parameters to the math
functions like so:

    use Math::BigFloat;
    $x = Math::BigFloat->new(2);
    $y = $x->copy()->bdiv(3);
    print $y->bround(5),"\n";               # gives 0.66667

    or

    use Math::BigFloat;
    $x = Math::BigFloat->new(2);
    $y = $x->copy()->bdiv(3,5);             # gives 0.66667
    print "$y\n";

=head2 Rounding

=over

=item bfround ( +$scale )

Rounds to the $scale'th place left from the '.', counting from the dot.
The first digit is numbered 1.

=item bfround ( -$scale )

Rounds to the $scale'th place right from the '.', counting from the dot.

=item bfround ( 0 )

Rounds to an integer.

=item bround  ( +$scale )

Preserves accuracy to $scale digits from the left (aka significant digits) and
pads the rest with zeros. If the number is between 1 and -1, the significant
digits count from the first non-zero after the '.'

=item bround  ( -$scale ) and bround ( 0 )

These are effectively no-ops.

=back

All rounding functions take as a second parameter a rounding mode from one of
the following: 'even', 'odd', '+inf', '-inf', 'zero', 'trunc' or 'common'.

The default rounding mode is 'even'. By using
C<< Math::BigFloat->round_mode($round_mode); >> you can get and set the default
mode for subsequent rounding. The usage of C<$Math::BigFloat::$round_mode> is
no longer supported.
The second parameter to the round functions then overrides the default
temporarily.

The C<as_number()> function returns a BigInt from a Math::BigFloat. It uses
'trunc' as rounding mode to make it equivalent to:

    $x = 2.5;
    $y = int($x) + 2;

You can override this by passing the desired rounding mode as parameter to
C<as_number()>:

    $x = Math::BigFloat->new(2.5);
    $y = $x->as_number('odd');      # $y = 3

=head1 NUMERIC LITERALS

After C<use Math::BigFloat ':constant'> all numeric literals in the given scope
are converted to C<Math::BigFloat> objects. This conversion happens at compile
time.

For example,

    perl -MMath::BigFloat=:constant -le 'print 2e-150'

prints the exact value of C<2e-150>. Note that without conversion of constants
the expression C<2e-150> is calculated using Perl scalars, which leads to an
inaccuracte result.

Note that strings are not affected, so that

    use Math::BigFloat qw/:constant/;

    $y = "1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
            + "123456789123456789";

does not give you what you expect. You need an explicit Math::BigFloat->new()
around at least one of the operands. You should also quote large constants to
prevent loss of precision:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    $x = Math::BigFloat->new("1234567889123456789123456789123456789");

Without the quotes Perl converts the large number to a floating point constant
at compile time, and then converts the result to a Math::BigFloat object at
runtime, which results in an inaccurate result.

=head2 Hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point literals

Perl (and this module) accepts hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point
literals, but use them with care with Perl versions before v5.32.0, because some
versions of Perl silently give the wrong result. Below are some examples of
different ways to write the number decimal 314.

Hexadecimal floating point literals:

    0x1.3ap+8         0X1.3AP+8
    0x1.3ap8          0X1.3AP8
    0x13a0p-4         0X13A0P-4

Octal floating point literals (with "0" prefix):

    01.164p+8         01.164P+8
    01.164p8          01.164P8
    011640p-4         011640P-4

Octal floating point literals (with "0o" prefix) (requires v5.34.0):

    0o1.164p+8        0O1.164P+8
    0o1.164p8         0O1.164P8
    0o11640p-4        0O11640P-4

Binary floating point literals:

    0b1.0011101p+8    0B1.0011101P+8
    0b1.0011101p8     0B1.0011101P8
    0b10011101000p-2  0B10011101000P-2

=head2 Math library

Math with the numbers is done (by default) by a module called
Math::BigInt::Calc. This is equivalent to saying:

    use Math::BigFloat lib => "Calc";

You can change this by using:

    use Math::BigFloat lib => "GMP";

B<Note>: General purpose packages should not be explicit about the library to
use; let the script author decide which is best.

Note: The keyword 'lib' will warn when the requested library could not be
loaded. To suppress the warning use 'try' instead:

    use Math::BigFloat try => "GMP";

If your script works with huge numbers and Calc is too slow for them, you can
also for the loading of one of these libraries and if none of them can be used,
the code will die:

    use Math::BigFloat only => "GMP,Pari";

The following would first try to find Math::BigInt::Foo, then Math::BigInt::Bar,
and when this also fails, revert to Math::BigInt::Calc:

    use Math::BigFloat lib => "Foo,Math::BigInt::Bar";

See the respective low-level library documentation for further details.

See L<Math::BigInt> for more details about using a different low-level library.

=head1 EXPORTS

C<Math::BigFloat> exports nothing by default, but can export the C<bpi()>
method:

    use Math::BigFloat qw/bpi/;

    print bpi(10), "\n";

=over

=item stringify, bstr()

Both stringify and bstr() now drop the leading '+'. The old code would return
'+1.23', the new returns '1.23'. See the documentation in L<Math::BigInt> for
reasoning and details.

=item brsft()

The following will probably not print what you expect:

    my $c = Math::BigFloat->new('3.14159');
    print $c->brsft(3,10),"\n";     # prints 0.00314153.1415

It prints both quotient and remainder, since print calls C<brsft()> in list
context. Also, C<< $c->brsft() >> will modify $c, so be careful.
You probably want to use

    print scalar $c->copy()->brsft(3,10),"\n";
    # or if you really want to modify $c
    print scalar $c->brsft(3,10),"\n";

instead.

=item Modifying and =

Beware of:

    $x = Math::BigFloat->new(5);
    $y = $x;

It will not do what you think, e.g. making a copy of $x. Instead it just makes
a second reference to the B<same> object and stores it in $y. Thus anything
that modifies $x will modify $y (except overloaded math operators), and vice
versa. See L<Math::BigInt> for details and how to avoid that.

=item precision() vs. accuracy()

A common pitfall is to use L</precision()> when you want to round a result to
a certain number of digits:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    Math::BigFloat->precision(4);           # does not do what you
                                            # think it does
    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(12345);     # rounds $x to "12000"!
    print "$x\n";                           # print "12000"
    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(3);         # rounds $y to "0"!
    print "$y\n";                           # print "0"
    $z = $x / $y;                           # 12000 / 0 => NaN!
    print "$z\n";
    print $z->precision(),"\n";             # 4

Replacing L</precision()> with L</accuracy()> is probably not what you want,
either:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    Math::BigFloat->accuracy(4);          # enables global rounding:
    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(123456);  # rounded immediately
                                          #   to "12350"
    print "$x\n";                         # print "123500"
    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(3);       # rounded to "3
    print "$y\n";                         # print "3"
    print $z = $x->copy()->bdiv($y),"\n"; # 41170
    print $z->accuracy(),"\n";            # 4

What you want to use instead is:

    use Math::BigFloat;

    my $x = Math::BigFloat->new(123456);    # no rounding
    print "$x\n";                           # print "123456"
    my $y = Math::BigFloat->new(3);         # no rounding
    print "$y\n";                           # print "3"
    print $z = $x->copy()->bdiv($y,4),"\n"; # 41150
    print $z->accuracy(),"\n";              # undef

In addition to computing what you expected, the last example also does B<not>
"taint" the result with an accuracy or precision setting, which would
influence any further operation.
