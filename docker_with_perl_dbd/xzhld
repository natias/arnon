Idea: For a window in the middle (has window above and below it), use
right-mouse-drag on the status line to move a window up/down without changing
its height?  It's like dragging the status bar above it at the same time.

Patch to add a :domodeline command. (Christian Brabandt, 2014 Oct 21)

'viewdir' default on MS-Windows is not a good choice, it's a system directory.
Change 'viewdir' to "$HOME/vimfiles/view" and use 'viewdiralt' to also read
from?

Include a plugin manager with Vim? vim-plug seems to be the best currently:
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.
Also Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
Or minpac: https://github.com/k-takata/minpac, since it leverages the builtin
package feature.
Long message about this from ZyX, 2014 Mar 23.  And following replies.
Also see http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de/wiki/topic/vim%20plugin%20managment.html
User view:
- Support multiple sources, basically any http:// URL. Or a central place that
  will work for everybody (github?  redirects from vim.org?).
  Be able to look into the files before deciding to install.
- Be able to try out a plugin and remove it again with (almost) no traces.
- Each plugin needs a "manifest" file that has the version, dependencies
  (including Vim version and features), conflicts, list of files, etc.
  Updater uses that to decide what/how to update.
  Dependencies can use a URL for specific versions, or short name for scripts
  on vim.org.
- Once a plugin is installed it remembers where it came from, updater checks
  there.  Can manually update when really needed.
- Must be possible to install for one user.  Also system wide?
- Can edit plugin config with Vim. Can temporarily disable a plugin.
- Run the update manually, find latest version and install.
- Be able to download without special tools, must work for 95% of users.
Implementation:
- Avoid the 'runtimepath' getting long.  Need some other way to keep each
  plugin separate.
- When installing or updating, first figure out what needs to be done. This
  may involve recursively fetching manifest files for dependencies.  Then show
  the user what's going to change and ask for OK.
- Scripts on Vim.org must be able to consist of several files.  Is zip format
  sufficient?  Upload the manifest?  Or refer to a site that has the manifest?
- Best is to fetch individual files or use a Vimball. Reduces dependency on
  tools that might be missing and allows inspection of the files before
  installing.
Out of scope:
- Overview of plugins, ratings, comments, etc.  That's another world.
- Development work on plugins (although diff with distributed version would be
  useful).

This does not work yet: "a\(%C\)" (get composing characters into a submatch).

Inconsistent: starting with $LANG set to es_ES.utf-8 gives Spanish
messages, even though locale is not supported.  But ":lang messages
es_ES.utf-8" gives an error and doesn't switch messages. (Dominique Pelle,
2009 Jan 26)

When $HOME contains special characters, such as a comma, escape them when used
in an option. (Michael Hordijk, 2009 May 5)
Turn "esc" argument of expand_env_esc() into string of chars to be escaped.

Should make 'ignorecase' global-local, so that it makes sense setting it from
a modeline.

Add cscope target to Makefile. (Tony Mechelynck, 2009 Jun 18, replies by

Completion for ":buf" doesn't work properly on Win32 when 'shellslash' is off.
(Henrik Ohman, 2009, Jan 29)

shellescape() depends on 'shellslash' for quoting.  That doesn't work when
'shellslash' is set but using cmd.exe. (Ben Fritz)
Use a different option or let it depend on whether 'shell' looks like a
unix-like shell?

Bug: in Ex mode (after "Q") backslash before line break, when yanked into a
register and executed, results in <Nul>: instead of line break.

Greek sigma character should be lower cased depending on the context.  Can we
make this work?  (Dominique Pelle, 2009 Sep 24)

When changing 'encoding' convert all the swap file names, so that we can
still delete them.  Also convert all buffer file names?

"gqip" in Insert mode has an off-by-one error, causing it to reflow text.
(Raul Coronado, 2009 Nov 2)

MS-Windows: editing the first, empty buffer, 'ffs' set to "unix,dos", ":enew"
doesn't set 'ff' to "unix".  (Ben Fritz, 2008 Dec 5) Reusing the old buffer
probably causes this.

'scrollbind' is not respected when deleting lines or undo. (Milan Vancura,
2009 Jan 16)

Having "Syntax" in 'eventignore' for :bufdo may cause problems, e.g. for
":bufdo e" when buffers are open in windows.  ex_listdo(eap) could set the
option only for when jumping to another buffer, not when the command argument
is executed.

":pedit %" with a BufReadPre autocommand causes the cursor to move to the
first line. (Ingo Karkat, 2008 Jul 1)  Ian Kelling is working on this.
Similar problem with ":e". (Marc Montu, 2014 Apr 22)

Cursor line moves in other window when using CTRL-W J that doesn't change
anything.  (Dasn, 2009 Apr 7)

On Unix "glob('does not exist~')" returns the string.  Without the "~" it
doesn't. (John Little, 2008 Nov 9)
Shell expansion returns unexpanded string?
Don't use shell when "~" is not at the start?

When using ":e ++enc=foo file" and the file is already loaded with
'fileencoding' set to "bar", then do_ecmd() uses that buffer, even though the
fileencoding differs.  Reload the buffer in this situation?  Need to check for
the buffer to be unmodified.
Unfinished patch by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 11.  Followup Jul 14, need to have
another look at it.

c.vim: XXX in a comment is colored yellow, but not when it's after "#if 0".
(Ilya Dogolazky, 2009 Aug 7)

You can type ":w ++bad=x fname", but the ++bad argument is ignored.  Give an
error message?  Or is this easy to implement?  (Nathan Stratton Treadway, 2008
Aug 20)  This is in ucs2bytes(), search for 0xBF.  Using the ++bad argument is
at the other match for 0xBF.

When adding "-complete=file" to a user command this also changes how the
argument is processed for <f-args>. (Ivan Tishchenko, 2008 Aug 19)

Win32: associating a type with Vim doesn't take care of space after a
backslash? (Robert Vibrant, 2008 Jun 5)

When 'rightleft' is set, cursorcolumn isn't highlighted after the end of a
line.  It's also wrong in folds. (Dominique Pelle, 2010 Aug 21)

":help s/~" jumps to *s/\~*, while ":help s/\~" doesn't find anything. (Tim
Chase)  Fix by Ian Kelling, 2008 Jul 14.

When mapping : to ; and ; to :, @; doesn't work like @: and @: doesn't work
either.  Matt Wozniski:  nv_at() calls do_execreg() which uses
put_in_typebuf().  Char mapped twice?

Despite adding save_subexpr() this still doesn't work properly:
Regexp: matchlist('12a4aaa', '^\(.\{-}\)\(\%5c\@<=a\+\)\(.\+\)\?')
Returns ['12a4', 'aaa', '4aaa'], should be ['12a4', 'aaa', '']
Backreference not cleared when retrying after \@<= fails?
(Brett Stahlman, 2008 March 8)

Problem with remote_send(). (Charles Campbell, 2008 Aug 12)

ftplugin for help file should set 'isk' to help file value.

Win32: remote editing fails when the current directory name contains "[".
(Ivan Tishchenko, Liu Yubao)  Suggested patch by Chris Lubinski: Avoid
escaping characters where the backslash is not removed later.  Asked Chris for
an alternate solution, also for src/ex_getln.c.
This also fails when the file or directory name contains "%". (Thoml, 2008
July 7)
Using --remote-silent while the current directory has a # in the name does not
work, the # needs to be escaped. (Tramblay Bruno, 2012 Sep 15)

When using remote-silent the -R flag is not passed on. (Axel Bender, 2012 May
31)

Win32: A --remote command that has a directory name starting with a ( doesn't
work, the backslash is removed, assuming that it escapes the (. (Valery
Kondakoff, 2009 May 13)

Unexpectedly inserting a double quote. (Anton Woellert, 2008 Mar 23)
Works OK when 'cmdheight' is 2.

8   Use a mechanism similar to omni completion to figure out the kind of tab

    several).

The utf class table is missing some entries:
	0x2212, minus sign

Visual line mode doesn't highlight properly when 'showbreak' is used and the
line doesn't fit. (Dasn, 2008 May 1)

GUI: In Normal mode can't yank the modeless selection.  Make "gy" do this?
Works like CTRL-Y in Command line mode.

":echoe" in catch block stops processing, while this doesn't happen outside of

Test 54 uses shell commands, that doesn't work on non-Unix systems.  Use some
other way to test buffer-local autocommands.

The documentation mentions the priority for ":2match" and ":3match", but it
appears the last one wins. (John Beckett, 2008 Jul 22)  Caused by adding
matchadd()?  Suggested patch by John, 2008 Jul 24.

When 'encoding' is utf-8 the command line is redrawn as a whole on every
character typed. (Tyler Spivey, 2008 Sep 3)  Only redraw cmdline for
'arabicshape' when there is a character on the command line for which
(ARABIC_CHAR(u8c)) is TRUE.

Autoconf problem: when checking for iconv library we may add -L/usr/local/lib,
but when compiling further tests -liconv is added without the -L argument,
that may fail (e.g., sizeof(int)). (Blaine, 2007 Aug 21)

Problem with ".add" files when using two languages and restarting Vim. (Raul
Coronado, 2008 Oct 30)

Popup menu redraw: Instead of first redrawing the text and then drawing the
popup menu over it, first draw the new popup menu, remember its position and
size and then redraw the text, skipping the characters under the popup menu.
This should avoid flicker.  Other solution by A.Politz, 2007 Aug 22.

When the file name has parenthesis, e.g., "foo (bar).txt", ":!ls '%'" has the
parenthesis escaped but not the space.  That's inconsistent.  Either escape
neither or both.  No escaping might be best, because it doesn't depend on
particularities of the shell. (Zvi Har'El, 2007 Nov 10) (Teemu Likonen, 2008
Jun 3)
However, for backwards compatibility escaping might be necessary.  Check if
the user put quotes around the expanded item?

A throw in a function causes missing an endif below the call. (Spiros

Error E324 can be given when a cron script has wiped out our temp directory.
Give a clear error message about this (and tell them not to wipe out /tmp).

Color for cUserLabel should differ from case label, so that a mistake in a
switch list is noticed:
    switch (i)
    {
    case 1:
    foobar:

Look at http://www.gtk-server.org/ .  It has a Vim script implementation.

Netbeans problem.  Use "nc -l 127.0.0.1 55555" for the server, then run gvim
with "gvim -nb:localhost:55555:foo".  From nc do: '1:editFile!0 "foo"'.  Then
go to Insert mode and add a few lines.  Then backspacing every other time
moves the cursor instead of deleting. (Chris Kaiser, 2007 Sep 25)

Windows installer could add a "open in new tab of existing Vim" menu entry.
GvimExt: patch to add "Edit with single Vim &tabbed" menu entry.

Win32: patch for fullscreen mode. (Liushaolin, 2008 April 17)

Win32: When 'shell' is bash shellescape() doesn't always do the right thing.
Depends on 'shellslash', 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote', but shellescape()
only takes 'shellslash' into account.

Menu item that does "xxd -r" doesn't work when 'fileencoding' is utf-16.
Check for this and use iconv?  (Edward L. Fox, 2007 Sep 12)
Does the conversion in the other direction work when 'fileencodings' is set

error.  without --remote-silent it works fine. (Ben Fritz, 2008 Jun 20)

GVim: dialog for closing Vim should check if Vim is busy writing a file.  Then
use a different dialog: "busy saving, really quit? yes / no".

Check other interfaces for changing curbuf in a wrong way.  Patch like for
if_ruby.c.

":helpgrep" should use the directory from 'helpfile'.

The need_fileinfo flag is messy.  Instead make the message right away and put
it in keep_msg?

Editing a file remotely that matches 'wildignore' results in a "no match"
error.  Should only happen when there are wildcards, not when giving the file
name literally, and esp. if there is only one name.

Test 61 fails sometimes.  This is a timing problem: "sleep 2" sometimes takes
longer than 2 seconds.

Using ":au CursorMoved * cmd" invokes mch_FullName(), which can be slow.
Can this be avoided? (Thomas Waba, 2008 Aug 24)
Also for ":w" without a file name.
The buffer has the full path in ffname, should pass this to the autocommand.

VMS: VFC files are in some cases truncated during reading (Zoltan Arpadffy)

input() completion should not insert a backslash to escape a space in a file
name?

Ruby completion is insecure.  Can this be fixed?

When 'backupskip' is set from $TEMP special characters need to be escaped.
(patch by Grembowietz, 2007 Feb 26, not quite right)
Another problem is that file_pat_to_reg_pat() doesn't recognize "\\", so "\\("
will be seen as a path separator plus "\(".

gvim d:\path\path\(FILE).xml should not remove the \ before the (.
This also fails with --remote.

When doing ":quit" the Netbeans "killed" event isn't sent.  (Xavier de Gaye,
2008 Nov 10)  call netbeans_file_closed() at the end of buf_freeall(), or in

Or the hunspell-ro.3.2.tar.gz file, it also has a iso-8859-2 list.

In a C file with spell checking, in "% integer" "nteger" is seen as an error,
but "]s" doesn't find it.  "nteger" by itself is found. (Ralf Wildenhues, 2008
Jul 22)

There should be something about spell checking in the user manual.

Add an option to specify the character to use when a double-width character is
moved to the next line.  Default '>', set to a space to blank it out.  Check
