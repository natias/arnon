Files:	    src/menu.c

Patch 7.0.177
Problem:    When the press-enter prompt gets a character from a non-remappable
	    mapping, it's put back in the typeahead buffer as remappable,
	    which may cause an endless loop.
Solution:   Restore the non-remappable flag and the silent flag when putting a
	    char back in the typeahead buffer.
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/message.c, src/normal.c

Patch 7.0.192
Problem:    When 'swapfile' is switched off in an empty file it is possible
	    that not all blocks are loaded into memory, causing ml_get errors
	    later.
Solution:   Rename "dont_release" to "mf_dont_release" and also use it to
	    avoid using the cached line and locked block.
Files:	    src/globals.h, src/memfile.c, src/memline.c

Patch 7.0.193
Problem:    Using --remote or --remote-tab with an argument that matches

Solution:   Add type casts.  Use "*" for processorArchitecture. (George Reilly)
Files:	    src/Make_mvc.mak, src/eval.c, src/gvim.exe.mnf, src/misc2.c

Patch 7.0.199
Problem:    When using multibyte characters the combination of completion and
	    formatting may result in a wrong cursor position.
Solution:   Don't decrement the cursor column, use dec_cursor(). (Yukihiro
	    Nakadaira)  Also check for the column to be zero.

Problem:    Some characters of the "gb18030" encoding are not handled
	    properly.
Solution:   Do not use "cp936" as an alias for "gb18030" encoding.  Instead
	    initialize 'encoding' to "cp936".
Files:	    src/mbyte.c, src/option.c

Patch 7.0.207
Problem:    After patch 2.0.203 CSI and K_SPECIAL characters are escaped when
	    recorded and then again when the register is executed.
Solution:   Remove escaping before putting the recorded characters in a
	    register.  (Yukihiro Nakadaira)
Files:	    src/getchar.c, src/ops.c, src/proto/getchar.pro

Patch 7.0.208 (after 7.0.171 and 7.0.180)

	    Help entry.  Call to MoreMasterPointers() is ignored.
Solution:   Call SetControlViewSize() in gui_mch_set_scrollbar_thumb().  Use
	    kCMHelpItemRemoveHelp for ContextualMenuSelect().  Remove call to
	    MoreMasterPointers(). (Nicolas Weber)
Files:	    src/gui_mac.c

Patch 7.0.216

Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 7.0.219
Problem:    When using the 'editexisting.vim' script and a file is being
	    edited in another tab page the window is split.  The "+123"
	    argument is not used.

Solution:   Check for not finding the window.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.221
Problem:    finddir() uses 'path' by default, where "." means relative to the
	    current file.  But it works relative to the current directory.
	    (Tye Zdrojewski)
Solution:   Add the current buffer name to find_file_in_path_option() for the
	    relative file name.
Files:	    runtime/doc/eval.txt, src/eval.c

	    to the 'pastetoggle' key.
Files:	    src/getchar.c

Patch 7.0.230
Problem:    After using ":lcd" a script doesn't know how to restore the
	    current directory.
Solution:   Add the haslocaldir() function. (Bob Hiestand)

Patch 7.0.231
Problem:    When recovering from a swap file the page size is likely to be
	    different from the minimum.  The block used for the first page
	    then has a buffer of the wrong size, causing a crash when it's
	    reused later.  (Zephaniah Hull)
Solution:   Reallocate the buffer when the page size changes.  Also check that
	    the page size is at least the minimum value.
Files:	    src/memline.c

Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.0.236
Problem:    Linux 2.4 uses sysinfo() with a mem_unit field, which is not

Solution:   Add an autoconf check for sysinfo.mem_unit.  Let mch_total_mem()
	    return Kbyte to avoid overflow.
Files:	    src/auto/configure, src/configure.in, src/config.h.in,
	    src/option.c, src/os_unix.c

Patch 7.0.237
Problem:    For root it is recommended to not use 'modeline', but in

Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 7.0.239
Problem:    When using local directories and tab pages ":mksession" uses a
	    short file name when it shouldn't.  Window-local options from a
	    modeline may be applied to the wrong window. (Teemu Likonen)
Solution:   Add the did_lcd flag, use the full path when it's set.  Don't use
	    window-local options from the modeline when using the current
	    window for another buffer in ":doautoall".
Files:	    src/fileio.c,  src/ex_docmd.c

Patch 7.0.240
Problem:    Crash when splitting a window in the GUI. (opposite of 7.0.227)
Solution:   Don't call out_flush() from win_alloc().  Also avoid this for
	    win_delete().  Also block autocommands while the window structure
	    is invalid.
Files:	    src/window.c

Patch 7.0.241
Problem:    ":windo throw 'foo'" loops forever. (Andy Wokula)
