from an uncomputed value.

This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system stores
the variable argument list datatype, va_list, in a format
that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some
other means must be used when copying is required.
As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision)
of copying mechanisms, F<handy.h> defines a platform-
C<independent> macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to do the job.

=item C<netdb_hlen_type>

to work on a shared library but that can not be used on an
archive library.  Currently, this is only used by Linux, where
nm --dynamic is *required* to get symbols from an C<ELF> library which
has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is *fatal* on an archive library.
Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

=item C<nonxs_ext>

From F<Extensions.U>:

This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions built and
installed by the package.  By default, all non-xs extensions
distributed will be built, with the exception of platform-specific

4.1.3, 5.2, etc.).  It is primarily used for helping select
an appropriate hints file, but might be useful elsewhere for
setting defaults.  It is set to '' if we can't figure it out.
We try to be flexible about how much of the version number
to keep, e.g. if 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 are essentially the
same for this package, hints files might just be F<os_4.0> or
F<os_4.1>, etc., not keeping separate files for each little release.

=item C<otherlibdirs>

From F<otherlibdirs.U>:

This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl
binary to search for additional library files or modules.
These directories will be tacked to the end of @C<INC>.
Perl will automatically search below each path for version-
and architecture-specific directories.  See inc_version_list
for more details.

for the next run through Configure.

From F<disparate_lc_all.U>:

This symbol, when defined, gives the C initializer for an array whose
element [0] is the first category in the string returned by
setlocale(C<LC_ALL>, C<NULL>) when not all categories are the same, on
systems that use a positional notation.  After element [0] is
$lc_all_separator_init, then the category given by element [1], and so on.

not necessarily the pathname of the file containing the perl
interpreter; you must append the executable extension (_exe) if

may not have been installed, or even if installed, may be a
different version of Perl.
