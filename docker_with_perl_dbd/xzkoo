=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::MakeMaker - Create a module Makefile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

  WriteMakefile(
      NAME              => "Foo::Bar",
      VERSION_FROM      => "lib/Foo/Bar.pm",
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module
from a Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by
Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.

It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines
that can be individually overridden.  Each subroutine returns the text
it wishes to have written to the Makefile.

As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which
use operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is
important for users of this module to know which flavour of Make
a Makefile has been written for so they'll use the correct one and
won't have to face the possibly bewildering errors resulting from
using the wrong one.

On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make; on Microsoft
Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make.
See the section on the L</"MAKE"> parameter for details.

ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory below the current
directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a separate
object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of
Makefiles with a single invocation of WriteMakefile().

All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just octets. EUMM
seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still not possible
to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because this requires
Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the case on Windows.

See L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ> for details of the design and usage.

=head2 How To Write A Makefile.PL

See L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Tutorial>.

The long answer is the rest of the manpage :-)

=head2 Default Makefile Behaviour

The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to invoke

  perl Makefile.PL # optionally "perl Makefile.PL verbose"
  make
  make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
  make install     # See below

The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of the
form C<KEY=VALUE>. E.g.

  perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~

Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are

  make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
  make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
  make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
  make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
  make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section

=head2 make test

MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named F<test.pl> in the
current directory, and if it exists it executes the script with the
proper set of perl C<-I> options.

MakeMaker also checks for any files matching glob("t/*.t"). It will
execute all matching files in alphabetical order via the
L<Test::Harness> module with the C<-I> switches set correctly.

You can also organize your tests within subdirectories in the F<t/> directory.
To do so, use the F<test> directive in your I<Makefile.PL>. For example, if you
had tests in:

    t/foo
    t/foo/bar

You could tell make to run tests in both of those directories with the
following directives:

    test => {TESTS => 't/*/*.t t/*/*/*.t'}
    test => {TESTS => 't/foo/*.t t/foo/bar/*.t'}

The first will run all test files in all first-level subdirectories and all
subdirectories they contain. The second will run tests in only the F<t/foo>
and F<t/foo/bar>.

If you'd like to see the raw output of your tests, set the
C<TEST_VERBOSE> variable to true.

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

If you want to run particular test files, set the C<TEST_FILES> variable.
It is possible to use globbing with this mechanism.

  make test TEST_FILES='t/foobar.t t/dagobah*.t'

Windows users who are using C<nmake> should note that due to a bug in C<nmake>,
when specifying C<TEST_FILES> you must use back-slashes instead of forward-slashes.

  nmake test TEST_FILES='t\foobar.t t\dagobah*.t'

=head2 make testdb

A useful variation of the above is the target C<testdb>. It runs the
test under the Perl debugger (see L<perldebug>). If the file
F<test.pl> exists in the current directory, it is used for the test.

If you want to debug some other testfile, set the C<TEST_FILE> variable
thusly:

  make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t

By default the debugger is called using C<-d> option to perl. If you
want to specify some other option, set the C<TESTDB_SW> variable:

  make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx

=head2 make install

make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named by
the macros INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_MAN1DIR and
INST_MAN3DIR.  All these default to something below ./blib if you are
I<not> building below the perl source directory. If you I<are>
building below the perl source, INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB default to
../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not defined.

The I<install> target of the generated Makefile copies the files found
below each of the INST_* directories to their INSTALL*
counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of
INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:

                                 INSTALLDIRS set to
                           perl        site          vendor

                 PERLPREFIX      SITEPREFIX          VENDORPREFIX
  INST_ARCHLIB   INSTALLARCHLIB  INSTALLSITEARCH     INSTALLVENDORARCH
  INST_LIB       INSTALLPRIVLIB  INSTALLSITELIB      INSTALLVENDORLIB
  INST_BIN       INSTALLBIN      INSTALLSITEBIN      INSTALLVENDORBIN
  INST_SCRIPT    INSTALLSCRIPT   INSTALLSITESCRIPT   INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT
  INST_MAN1DIR   INSTALLMAN1DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
  INST_MAN3DIR   INSTALLMAN3DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR

The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their %Config
($Config{installprivlib}, $Config{installarchlib}, etc.) counterparts.

You can check the values of these variables on your system with

    perl '-V:install.*'

And to check the sequence in which the library directories are
searched by perl, run

    perl -le 'print join $/, @INC'

Sometimes older versions of the module you're installing live in other
directories in @INC.  Because Perl loads the first version of a module it
finds, not the newest, you might accidentally get one of these older
versions even after installing a brand new version.  To delete I<all other
versions of the module you're installing> (not simply older ones) set the
C<UNINST> variable.

    make install UNINST=1


=head2 INSTALL_BASE

INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where your
module will be installed.  INSTALL_BASE is more like what everyone
else calls "prefix" than PREFIX is.

To have everything installed in your home directory, do the following.

    # Unix users, INSTALL_BASE=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/path/to/your/home/dir

Like PREFIX, it sets several INSTALL* attributes at once.  Unlike
PREFIX it is easy to predict where the module will end up.  The
installation pattern looks like this:

    INSTALLARCHLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5/$Config{archname}
    INSTALLPRIVLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5
    INSTALLBIN         INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLSCRIPT      INSTALL_BASE/bin
    INSTALLMAN1DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man1
    INSTALLMAN3DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man3

INSTALL_BASE in MakeMaker and C<--install_base> in Module::Build (as
of 0.28) install to the same location.  If you want MakeMaker and
Module::Build to install to the same location simply set INSTALL_BASE
and C<--install_base> to the same location.

INSTALL_BASE was added in 6.31.


=head2 PREFIX and LIB attribute

PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in one
go.  Here's an example for installing into your home directory.

    # Unix users, PREFIX=~ works fine
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/home/dir

This will install all files in the module under your home directory,
with man pages and libraries going into an appropriate place (usually
~/man and ~/lib).  How the exact location is determined is complicated
and depends on how your Perl was configured.  INSTALL_BASE works more
like what other build systems call "prefix" than PREFIX and we
recommend you use that instead.

Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single
parameter is LIB.

    perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib

This will install the module's architecture-independent files into
~/lib, the architecture-dependent files into ~/lib/$archname.

Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker, not
by perl by default, nor by make.

Conflicts between parameters LIB, PREFIX and the various INSTALL*
arguments are resolved so that:

=over 4

=item *

setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLSITEARCH (and they are not affected by PREFIX);

=item *

without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial C<$Config{prefix}>
part of those INSTALL* arguments, even if the latter are explicitly
set (but are set to still start with C<$Config{prefix}>).

=back

If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS or
relatives, then the defaults for INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate, and this incantation will be
the best:

    perl Makefile.PL;
    make;
    make test
    make install

make install by default writes some documentation of what has been
done into the file C<$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod>. This feature
can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.

=head2 AFS users

will have to specify the installation directories as these most
probably have changed since perl itself has been installed. They will
have to do this by calling

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
        INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages
    make

Be careful to repeat this procedure every time you recompile an
extension, unless you are sure the AFS installation directories are
still valid.

=head2 Static Linking of a new Perl Binary

An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on
systems supporting dynamic loading. On systems that do not support
dynamic loading, any newly created extension has to be linked together
with the available resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process
by creating appropriate targets in the Makefile whenever an extension
is built. You can invoke the corresponding section of the makefile with

    make perl

That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all
extensions linked in that can be found in INST_ARCHLIB, SITELIBEXP,
and PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on
UNIX, this is called F<Makefile.aperl> (may be system dependent). If you
want to force the creation of a new perl, it is recommended that you
