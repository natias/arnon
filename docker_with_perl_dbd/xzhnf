==============================================================================
VERSION 7.3					*version-7.3* *version7.3*

This section is about improvements made between version 7.2 and 7.3.

This release has hundreds of bug fixes and there are a few new features.  The
most notable new features are:


Persistent undo					*new-persistent-undo*
---------------

Store undo information in a file.  Can undo to before when the file was read,
also for unloaded buffers. See |undo-persistence| (partly by Jordan Lewis)

Added the ":earlier 1f" and ":later 1f" commands.
Added file save counter to undo information.
Added the |undotree()| and |undofile()| functions.

Also added the 'undoreload' option.  This makes it possible to save the
current text when reloading the buffer, so that the reload can be undone.


More encryption					*new-more-encryption*
---------------

Support for Blowfish encryption.  Added the 'cryptmethod' option.
Mostly by Mohsin Ahmed.

Also encrypt the text in the swap file and the undo file.


Conceal text					*new-conceal*
------------

Added the |+conceal| feature.  (Vince Negri)
This allows hiding stretches of text, based on syntax highlighting.
It also allows replacing a stretch of text by a character |:syn-cchar|.
The 'conceallevel' option specifies what happens with text matching a syntax
item that has the conceal attribute.
The 'concealcursor' option specifies what happens in the cursor line.

The help files conceal characters used to mark tags and examples.

Added the |synconcealed()| function and use it for :TOhtml. (Benjamin Fritz)

Added the 'cursorbind' option, keeps the cursor in two windows with the same
text in sync.


Lua interface					*new-lua*
-------------

Added the |Lua| interface.  (Luis Carvalho)


Python3 interface				*new-python3*
-----------------

Added the Python3 interface.  It exists next to Python 2.x, both can be used
at the same time.  See |python3| (Roland Puntaier)


Changed							*changed-7.3*
-------

The MS-Windows installer no longer requires the user to type anything in the
console windows.  The installer now also works on 64 bit systems, including
the "Edit with Vim" context menu.
The gvim executable is 32 bits, the installed gvimext.dll is either a 32 or 64
bit version. (mostly by George Reilly)
Made the DOS installer work with more compilers.
The MS-Windows big gvim is now built with Python 2.7 and 3.1.2, Perl 5.12 and
Ruby 1.9.1.  You need the matching .dll files to use them.

The extra and language files are no longer distributed separately.
The source files for all systems are included in one distribution.

After using ":recover" or recovering a file in another way, ":x" and "ZZ"
didn't save what you see.  This could result in work being lost.  Now the text
after recovery is compared to the original file contents.  When they differ
the buffer is marked as modified.

When Vim is exiting because of a deadly signal, when v:dying is 2 or more,
VimLeavePre, VimLeave, BufWinLeave and BufUnload autocommands are not
executed.

Removed support for GTK 1.  It was no longer maintained and required a lot of
#ifdefs in the source code.  GTK 2 should be available for every system.
(James Vega)

It is no longer allowed to set the 'encoding' option from a modeline.  It
would corrupt the text.  (Patrick Texier)

Renamed runtime/spell/fixdup to runtime/spell/fixdup.vim.

Removed obsolete Mac code.

Updated spell files for Ubuntu locale names.

Switched from autoconf 2.63 to 2.65.

Removed Mupad indent and ftplugin files, they are not useful.

The maximum number of messages remembered in the history is now 200 (was 100).

Patch 7.2.001
Problem:    Mac: pseudo-ttys don't work properly on Leopard, resulting in the
	    shell not to have a prompt, CTRL-C not working, etc.
Solution:   Don't use SVR4 compatible ptys, even though they are detected.
	    (Ben Schmidt)
Files:	    src/pty.c

Files:	    src/if_cscope.c, src/if_cscope.h

Patch 7.2.005
Problem:    A few problems when profiling.  Using flag pointer instead of flag
	    value.  Allocating zero bytes.  Not freeing used memory.
Solution:   Remove wrong '&' characters.  Skip dumping when there is nothing
	    to dump.  Free used memory. (Dominique Pelle)
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.2.006
Problem:    HTML files are not recognized by contents.
Solution:   Add a rule to the scripts file. (Nico Weber)
Files:	    runtime/scripts.vim

Patch 7.2.007 (extra)

	    src/testdir/Make_vms.mms, src/testdir/test30.in,
	    src/testdir/test54.in

Patch 7.2.008
Problem:    With a BufHidden autocommand that invokes ":bunload" the window
	    count for a buffer can be wrong. (Bob Hiestand)
Solution:   Don't call enter_buffer() when already in that buffer.
Files:	    src/buffer.c

Patch 7.2.009
Problem:    Can't compile with Perl 5.10 on MS-Windows. (Cesar Romani)

	    where a List would be converted to a String.
Files:	    src/eval.c

Patch 7.2.012
Problem:    Compiler warnings when building with startup timing.
Solution:   Add type casts.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds2.c

	    Time out after a couple of seconds to avoid a hang when the
	    selection owner isn't responding.
Files:	    src/ui.c

	    events until the callback is actually called.  Also dispatch the
	    PropertyNotify event.
Files:	    src/ui.c

Solution:   Subtract w_skipcol or w_leftcol when needed.
Files:	    src/screen.c

Patch 7.2.024
Problem:    It's possible to set 'history' to a negative value and that causes

Patch 7.2.027
Problem:    Can use cscope commands in the sandbox.
Solution:   Disallow them, they might not be safe.

Solution:   Remove prematurely added ex_oldfiles.
Files:	    src/ex_cmds.h

Patch 7.2.031
Problem:    Information in the viminfo file about previously edited files is
	    not available to the user.  There is no way to get a complete list
	    of files edited in previous Vim sessions.
Solution:   Add v:oldfiles and fill it with the list of old file names when
	    first reading the viminfo file.  Add the ":oldfiles" command,
	    ":browse oldfiles" and the "#<123" special file name.  Increase
	    the default value for 'viminfo' from '20 to '100.
