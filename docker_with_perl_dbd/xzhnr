==============================================================================
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				*incompatible-8*

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 7.4 to 8.0.


Better defaults without a vimrc ~

When no vimrc file is found, the |defaults.vim| script is loaded to set more
useful default values for new users.  That includes setting 'nocompatible'.
Thus Vim no longer starts up in Vi compatible mode.  If you do want that,
either create a .vimrc file that does "set compatible" or start Vim with
"vim -C".


Support removed ~

The support for MS-DOS has been removed.  It hasn't been working for a while
(Vim doesn't fit in memory) and removing it cleans up the code quite a bit.

The support for Windows 16 bit (Windows 95 and older) has been removed.

The support for OS/2 has been removed.  It probably hasn't been working for a
while since nobody uses it.

The SNiFF+ support has been removed.


Minor incompatibilities: ~

Probably...

==============================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS						*improvements-8*

The existing blowfish encryption turned out to be much weaker than it was
supposed to be.  The blowfish2 method has been added to fix that.  Note that
this still isn't a state-of-the-art encryption, but good enough for most
usage.  See 'cryptmethod'.


==============================================================================
COMPILE TIME CHANGES					*compile-changes-8*

The Vim repository was moved from Google code to github, since Google code
was shut down.  It can now be found at https://github.com/vim/vim.

Functions now use ANSI-C declarations.  At least a C-89 compatible compiler is
required.

The +visual feature is now always included.

==============================================================================
